eﬀorts to study these combined non-linear eﬀects are ongoing
(Hotta 2017; Korre et al. 2021). Despite the limitations of ex-
isting hydrodynamical simulations, they are already providing
constraints on physical processes usually treated with several
free parameters in 1D stellar evolution models. They can thus
limit the degrees of freedom in a problem as complex as so-
