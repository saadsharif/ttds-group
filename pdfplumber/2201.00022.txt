2.4. Mass Growth
When a BH collides with a star, it may accrete ma-
terial and grow in mass. The details of the accretion
depend on the relative velocity between the BH and
star. For simplicity, this calculation assumes that the
two objects experience a head on collision, with the BH
passing through the star’s center. We begin by con-
sidering the escape velocity from the BH at the star’s
outermost point, its surface, which corresponds to the
maximum impact parameter 1 R . Qualitatively, one
