I. I
Analyzing the thermal structure of coronal loops is of considerable interest, especially as these
magnetic loops have an essential role in heating the solar chromosphere and corona. Such anal-
ysis can help to describe how the process of solar ﬂaring is correlated with the loop’s thermal
structure.

Berghmans&Clette(1999);De Moorteletal.(2000),Verwichte etal.(2004),De Moortel&Brady
(2007), Ballai et al. (2011)). Coronal seismology and MHD waves have been reviewed widely by

DeMoortel(2005),Nakariakov&Verwichte(2005),Aschwanden(2006),Banerjeeetal.(2007)and
De Moortel & Nakariakov (2012). Along with the development of the observations, transverse
and longitudinal oscillations have also been studied theoretically (e.g., Gruszecki et al. (2006),
Pascoe et al. (2007), Fathalian et al. (2010); Luna et al. (2010); Fathalian & Safari(2010). Coronal

Nisticò et al. (2013),Anﬁnogentov et al. (2013),Hindman & Jain(2014),Russell etal. (2015)). As
we know the transverse loops oscillations usually occur in response to a close ﬁlament or ﬂare
(Wills-Davey&Thompson (1999)).
Rapidly decaying long-period oscillations are mostly interpreted as global (or fundamen-
tal mode) standing slow magnetoacoustic waves (reviewed by Liu & Ofman (2014), and Wang
(2011), also see Ofman & Wang (2002), and for slow-mode observed in fan-loops see Pant et al.
(2017)). They often occur in hot coronal loops of active regions, associated with tiny (or micro-)
ﬂares.Increasingevidence hassuggested thatthe harmonic type of decayingpulsations detected

et al. (2019); Krishna Prasad et al. (2019); Reale et al. (2019); Wang & Ofman (2019)). To have

Wangetal.(2021).

oscillations and the ﬂare impact on them. Several differentmethods have been developed to in-
vestigatethethermalstructureofthecoronalloopsandloopstrands. Thethermalstabilityofthe
coronal loops was the subject of research,done by Habbal& Rosner (1979)(andreferencescited
therein). McClymont & Craig (1985) stated that a pressure ﬂuctuation must assist asymmetric
coronal temperature perturbation. They concluded that coronal loops are impartially stable in
thecaseofuniformheating. VanDoorsselaereetal.(2011)usedspectroscopiclineratiostoobtain
the required temperature (via CHIANTI code) and estimated the adiabatic index of the corona.
The dependence of coronal loop temperature on loop length and magnetic ﬁeld strength is also
a favorite topic. For instance, Dahlburg et al. (2018) probed the temperature properties of solar
coronal loops over a wide range of lengths and magnetic ﬁeld strengths via numerical simula-
tions and observed a very high correlation between magnetic ﬁeld strength and a maximum of
thetemperature. Theeffectoftemperatureinhomogeneityontheperiodsandthedampingtimes

(2012)). Fathalian(2019)estimatedthelooptemperatureusingtheintensityratiosandtheAIAre-
sponse functionsindifferentwavelengths. Differentemissionmeasure(DEM)computationsand
methods have been developed to estimate the temperature in the corona, which led to various
discussions. Schmelz et al. (2010)analyzed a coronal loop, which was observed on 2010August
3,byAIA.Theytooksomedifferentialemissionmeasure(DEM)curves,claimingamultithermal
ratherthananisothermal DEMdistribution (forthe cross-sectionaltemperatureof theloop). Af-
ter that, Aschwanden & Boerner (2011) criticized the method of background subtraction which
Schmelz et al. had applied. They claimed that the background subtraction method caused their
inferredresultof amultithermal loop. Aschwanden& Boerner(2011)analyzedasetof hundred
loops and understood that 66% of the loops could be ﬁtted with a narrowband single-Gaussian
DEM model. In this regard, some attention was paid to the instrumental limitations and abil-
ity of AIA and Guennou et al. (2012a,b) discussed on the accuracy of the differential emission
measure diagnostics of solar plasmas in respect of the AIA instrument of SDO. The abovemen-
tioned controversy of whether the cross-ﬁeld temperaturesof coronal loops are multithermal or
isothermal, continued by Schmelz et al. (2013) (similar to Schmelz et al. (2011)). They analyzed
twelveloopstounderstandthecross-ﬁeldtemperaturedistributionsofthemandrevealtheloops’
substructure. Based on their achievements, the warmer loops entail broader DEMs. Thereafter,
Schmelzetal.(2014)foundindicationsofarelationshipbetweentheDEMweighted-temperature
and the cross-ﬁeld DEM width for coronal loops. They argued that cooler loops tend to have
narrower DEM widths. This could imply that fewer strands are seen emitting in the later cool-
ing phase, which they claim could potentially resolve the abovementioned controversy. In this
subject, Aschwanden et al. (2015) (as well as 2013 (Aschwanden, 2013)) developed a method to
extract the loop temperature which is based on Gaussian ﬁt for Differential Emission Measure,
namedspatially-synthesizedGaussianDEMforward-ﬁttingmethod (DEMhereafter).

region, extractitsloops and analyzetheir thermal treatment. Then we comparethe temperature
treatment of the loops at the ﬂaring region with the loops of the non-ﬂaring region to see the
differences.
The temperature analysis done here uses EUV images from the AIA onboard the SDO. AIA
has ten differentwavelength channels, three in white light and UV, and the other seven in EUV
channels. Betweentheseseven,the304ﬁlter,whichismostly sensitivetochromospheric temper-

X-ﬂare, which occurs near the loops is of rare cases. We consider EUV images of NOAA
AR11283,inthe time periodof22:10UTtill23:00UTof 2011September6withthe cadence
of 12 sec. This period of time is selected since no other ﬂare is happening during it. A
few distinct loops are visible and follow-able here during this period. Loop shapes in our
active region change permanently; therefore, it is difﬁcult or impossible to follow a loop
over a very long time. Hence, it is not useful to extend the time interval of this region
to the time before the ﬂare. The transverse oscillations of two loops in this region were
analyzed before by Jain et al. (2015). We mark these loops by A and B in Figure 1 b. They
detected fundamental mode oscillation with periods of roughly 2 minutes and decay time
of 5 minutes for these loops. We are curious to see the loops’ thermal oscillations (if any)
or thermal ﬂuctuations in this condition. Figure 1a (left) displays AR 11283 and the area,
indicated by the white box is featured in a zoom-in view in Figure 1.b (right) and the ﬁve
selected parts of the center of the three chosen loops are shown by red lines (the movie of

and its width and height are 615′′ ×615′′ /1025×1025 pixels. We consider the images of
the selected area with the cadence of 12 sec in the same six wavelengths mentioned above.
These loops are relatively motionless and do not show any transversal oscillation (see the
region’s movie in the link). We select the loops in such a way that they do not have any
crossing over the neighbor loops (in our perspective) during this time. In ﬁgure 2 the

The data set are primarily downloaded at level 1 with a pixel resolution of 0.6 arcsec. We use
the standard aia_prep.pro subroutine available in SDO package SolarSoftWare library to adjust
the screen scale between the four arms of the AIA. This pre-processing step increases the data
level from 1 to 1.5, so that ﬁnally no jump or sudden movement is observed in the image series.
We alsoused drot_map.pro subroutine tocorrectthe differentialrotationeffect. Accordingtothe

ﬁgures)areselectedineachregion(withobvioustransversaloscillationsinthecaseoftheﬂaring

We extract the selected loop segment pixels, for each loop, and calculate the normal vectors
to each point of the loop’s direction. Then by using these data, we straighten each loop in a
considered box with the thickness of 15 to 40 pixels (macro-pixels, depending on the available
empty area around each loop and the distance to the neighbor loop). The area around the
loop is needed for calculations of background subtraction. The selected loop segment is cut in

all wavelengths and at the same considered box from the images set. These loop images are
necessary entrances for our thermal analysis process. Then the loop is divided into different
strips and its best division in terms of pixel intervals is considered. To do thermal analysis, we
use the spatially-synthesized Gaussian DEM forward-ﬁtting method founded by Aschwanden
etal.(2015).
The images in the above six wavelength ﬁlters are considered to calculate the temperature in
eachstripoftheloop. TheDEMfunctionisconsideredasingle-Gaussianfunctionrelativetothe

wedivided the loop into narrowstrips, and then the intensity ﬂux was averagedovereachstrip.
The number of each strip is displayed with the index i. One of the usual methods to subtract
the background from observed data is ﬁtting a single-Gaussian cospatial function with a linear
function on the ﬂux proﬁle. The DEM for each strip is considered to be single-Gaussian DEM
in terms of the logarithm of the temperature, which has three free parameters (Aschwanden &
Boerner,2011):

Our data sample is uneven because of omitting some damaged images in between. There-
fore to analyze the temperature oscillations, we use the Lomb-Scargle method. This method is
developed to use the technique periodogram, in the case where the observation times are un-
evenly spaced (Scargle, 1982). The Lomb-Scargle periodogram method is useful in cases where
the periodicityof datatreatmentisnot immediatelyapparent. Thismethod allowsefﬁcientcom-
putation of a Fourier-like power spectrum estimator from unevenly-sampled data, resulting in
anintuitive meansof determining the period ofoscillation (VanderPlas,2018). Thereforewe use
Lomb-Scargle Periodogram to evaluate and estimate the efﬁcient periods of temperature oscilla-
tions in our loops. We select the ﬁrst period related to the highest power frequency, which is
obtained by this method.We considered the achieved periods with the highest signiﬁcances and
amplitudes. The most signiﬁcant (highest) periods observed in temperature (minute) for ﬂaring
and non-ﬂaring loops are listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. To estimate the signiﬁcance of
the periods, we computed the probability values (p-values). In the Lomb-Scargle method, the
signiﬁcance returned here is the false alarm probability of the null hypothesis, i.e., as the data
is composed of independent Gaussian random variables. Accordingly, low probability values

i. Temperature Analysis of Flaring Active Region Loops
Thenceforth the temperature time-series of different strips of the selected loops are calculated
using the method described in section 3. In the following ﬁgures, the vertical axis shows the
logarithmofthetemperatureandthehorizontalaxisshowsthetimeduration. Tobecomparable
byeyes,alltheforthcomingﬁgures(whichshowtheloopstemperatureoscillations)havebeenco-

strip’slengthisequalto4pixels(macro-pixel),forallloopsinthispaper. Forbrevity,afewstrips’
temperature oscillations are presented here. Figure 3 displays the time-series of temperature
oscillations for the ﬁrst 3 strips of Loop A, and ﬁrst 2 strips of loops B1. We calculated the
errorsforeachpoint(temperature)butremovedinthepresentationtoavoidovercrowdingofthe
ﬁgures. As we observe in Figures 3 and 4), the temperature oscillations are started and increase
around 22:12 before the ﬂare peak time (22:20) and are mostly continuing after the ﬂare ended
(22:24). These temperature oscillations follow the transverse loop oscillations observed by Jain
et al. (2015). As Jain et al. reported, LoopA and B have a transverse oscillation with periods
of roughly 2 minutes and decay times of 5 minutes, starting at 22:18around the ﬂare peak time
(23:20)anddecayingaftertheﬂareended(22:24). Soasweobserve,thetemperatureoscillationsin
theseﬂaringloopshappenbeforethestartoftheirtransverseoscillationsandarecontinuingeven
inthe time intervalafterthe transverseoscillations decay. Although the temperatureoscillations
do not decay as rapid as the transverse oscillations do, and conversely, the loop temperature
increases at the end of the oscillating mode (see Fig.4, the temperature map of the loop A, for
instance)
We calculate the temperature oscillations periods, using Lomb-Scargle method. We consider
the thermal oscillations periods with the highest signiﬁcances. As this method shows, the most
powerful period in the range of data time-series (listed in Table1) are from 7 to 28.4 minutes
observed in the strips of the marked loops of this ﬂaring region. These loops of ﬂaring region
also show some short periods in temperature oscillations which some are less than 10 minutes
(listed in Table1). These short periods are more frequently observed in the loops of the ﬂaring
active region. Such short periods are very scarce for the loops of the non-ﬂaring active region
(compareTables1and2).
The ﬁrstcolumn inTable1is the number of everystrip along the loop. The second column is
the period of the most powerfulfrequency observed for the loop strips, calculated by the Lomb-
Scargle method. The third column shows the maximum of log(T) minus its minimum in each
strip. The columns of Table2 are exactly the same as Table1; the only differenceis that Table2 is
forthenon-ﬂaringloops.
The loop A, has the length of 42.3 (Mm) which is the length of the selected part of the loop
markedinFigure1.b. Themeanoftheparameter(Max(logT)-Min(logT))forthestripsofloopA
is 1.21. Meanof the temperature(log) of this loop over time is6.15±0.25. The loop B1, divided
into 11 strips, has the length of 20.24(Mm). The mean of (Max(logT)-Min(logT)) and the mean
of the temperature for this loop are, 1.10, and 6.28±0.22respectively. The loop B2, which has 8
strips, with the length of 15.61 (Mm), has the mean temperature (log) of 6.21±0.21. The mean
of (Max(logT)-Min(logT))is0.81through thisloop segment. The loops C1andC2,dividedinto
12, and 6 strips, have the lengths of 22.08and 11.06(Mm),the mean temperaturesof 6.25±0.22,
and6.14±0.25(log),andthemean(Max(logT)-Min(logT))of1.48,0.88,respectively.
We observe that despite the temperature oscillations, the ﬂaring loops show a temperature
rise at the end of the considered time interval (ﬁgure3). As their temperature maps also show,
theoscillationsfollowwitharelativelysensibleriseintheﬁnaltemperatureoftheloopsegments
(Figures 4). Although in the case of the transverse oscillations, the loops oscillate as the ﬂare
occurs and then the oscillations decayand stop, in the case of temperature oscillations, the tem-
peratures of the various strips of the loops oscillate and at the end of the ﬂare occurrence, they
gettoarelativelyhigher valueoftemperatureinaverage.
Figure 4 shows the temperaturemapsof the ﬂaring loops A, B1, B2, C1, and C2, respectively
asatime series. Ineachplot,theverticalaxisisthe distancealongtheloop segmentinMm,and
the horizontal axis shows time. The color bar (in the left) shows the temperature range. Each
separated grid part on the map is standing for one strip. Figure 4 shows that the temperature
formostofthestripsincreased,bypassingafewoscillations. Beforetheendofthetimeduration,
some strips become hotter (yellow ones) and some cooler (blue ones). The loop B1 is colder at
the early times of the duration and becomes hotter at the middle and end times with a swing
to lower temperaturesagain(see Fig. 4). Thereare some temperatureﬂuctuations atthe middle
times(theredandgreenstripes)whileattheendthe stripstemperaturesaresmoother withless
ﬂuctuations. Thetemperaturemapoftheloop segmentB2(Fig.4)showsthatatthebeginningof
thetimeduration,theﬁrststripsofthelooparehotter,andthelastonesarecolder,butattheend
times this pattern is reversed in this loop segment. In loop segment C1 (Fig.4), the temperature
ﬂuctuations are mainly observed to start after the end of the ﬂare (22:24), and at the end time
(23:00) the temperature is much higher than the beginning. The temperature is increasing after
the ﬂare time (22:24) for the loop C2 either (see Fig.4). This happens with some oscillations in
the strips’ temperatures. So as ﬁgure 4 shows, the temperature increases with some ﬂuctuation
in most of the ﬂaring loops’ strips after the ﬂare time. According to these temperature maps,
thetemperatureﬂuctuationsinthe ﬂaringloopsareincreasingattheﬂaringtimeandaround20
minutesafterthat.
We expectthe ﬂaringloopstocool downasaresultofheatconductionand radiativecooling.
Hence this relativetemperature increase should be scrutinized. As we probed, this temperature
riseisalsofollowedinintensitytime-series. Astheintensitytime-seriesshow,therelatedintensity
in the Loop A of the ﬂaring AR increases at the end of the time duration. To be assured, the
authors also checked the wavelength of Fe XVIII which has a peak formation temperature of
7×106◦K(Ugarte-Urra&Warren(2014)). ByusingthemethoddevelopedbyWarrenetal.(2012)
the contribution of the Fe XVIII emission line can be isolated from the AIA 94 , to analyze the
evolutionof hotplasmaintheloops. Wedoittoomitthe contaminationfromthe coolerplasma
(mostly around 1MK) which also contributes to this AIA channel Boerner et al. (2012). This is
done by subtracting the contaminating warm (i.e., around 1MK) component to the bandpass.
ThiswarmcontributioniscalculatedfromaweightedcombinationoftheemissionfromtheAIA
171 and 193 channels dominated by Fe X and Fe XII emission, respectively. This intensity
analysisisdone directlyandithasnotgone through anyother processlikethe thermalanalysis.
For this purpose, we applied the formulation (1) used by Li et al. (2015). Plots in Figure 5 show
the intensity map, and the mean intensity variation of the wavelength Fe XVIII, for Loop A of
the ﬂaring region, respectively. As these plots show, this intensity is also higher at the end of
the time duration in respect of the ﬂare time. It seems to us that the expected cooling has not
occurredin these ﬂaringloops yet, evenafterthe ﬂareoccurrence in the probed duration due to
someplausiblereasons. WeconsiderthatthementionedsimultaneousCME(seesectionII)which
this ﬂare is associated with could cause this increase in temperature. We can be sure that the
source of this CME is AR 11283 (Romano et al. (2015)). This CME is in our ﬂare region, hence
the loops receive energy even after the ﬂare occurrence and it is probably the reason why the
expectedcoolingdoesnotoccur.
The thermal oscillations periods obtained the Lomb-Scargle method, do not have the same
signiﬁcanceinallstripsoftheloops,butformoststripsoftheﬂaringloops,thesigniﬁcancesare
very near to one. To be assured about these oscillations, we probed the intensity time-series for
each strip of the loops and we observed that this loop’s intensities shows intensity oscillations
too (i.e., alongside the loop). The most probable dominant periods observed in intensity, for
wavelengthof171 is18.22,and16.7minfor stripsof F-Loop A, 16.7,and 18.22min for stripsof
F-LoopB1,16.70,and12.52forF-LoopB2,and16.7forF-LoopC1andF-LoopC2. Theseperiods

has not passed any thermal process but still shows oscillation periods close to thermal ones. So
wethinkthese resultsconﬁrmtheobservation ofthermaloscillations.
ii. Temperature Analysis of non-Flaring Active Region Loops
The temperature time-series for different strips of the selected loops of the non-ﬂaring active
region 12194 are calculated using the Lomb-Scargle method. In the following ﬁgures (Fig. 6),
the vertical axis shows the logarithm of the temperature and the horizontal axis shows the time
duration. Figure 6 displays the time-series of temperature variations for the ﬁrst two strips of
the non-ﬂaring Loops A, and B. These ﬁgures are all co-scaled in the range of 5.7 to 6.9 for the
logarithm of temperature (like the ﬂaring loops range). The most powerfulperiods, observed in
most of these non-ﬂaring loops’ strips (listedin Table2)arefrom8.5min. to30min. Comparing
the periods of the loops in the ﬂaring region (Table1) with the non-ﬂaring one (Table2), we see
that the temperature periods of the ﬂaring loops have lower values on average and have more
diversity than the non-ﬂaring ones. As Tables 1 and 2 show, the mean temperatures of nonf-
loops are lower in comparison with the f-loops, a fact we also expected from common sense.

The ﬁrst highest period observed for the temperature oscillations of these non-ﬂaring loops’
strips is reported in Table2. As we observe the temperature periods in these non-ﬂaring loops
aremostlylongerthanthoseoftheﬂaringloops(comparethevalueslistedinTable1andTable2).

Each separated colored part in the map is one strip. These color maps are plotted totally at the

As ﬁgure 7 shows, the strips’ temperatureof these non-ﬂaring loops have fewer temperature
ﬂuctuations and are smoother in comparison with the ﬂaring ones (Fig. 4). Furthermore, that
much increase in the temperatures of the strips, which was obvious in the loops of the ﬂaring

We reported the temperature oscillations of coronal loops of a ﬂaring active region. We selected
theﬂaringactiveregion11283toinvestigatethethermalstructureandtreatmentofitsloops. This
regionincludesahighenergyﬂarex2.1andthetransverseoscillationsoftwoloopsofithavebeen
analyzed before by Jain et al. (2015). They analyzed intensity variations in the wavelength 171
in two coronal loops of this region and detected obvious transverse oscillation with periods of
roughly 2 minutes and decay times of 5 minutes for these loops (loops A and B in Figure.1b)
at the ﬂare time. We were curious to know if the temperature variations follow the transverse
oscillations of the loops, or there isanyrelationor correlationbetweenthem. We also wanted to
investigate the thermal ﬂuctuations at the ﬂare time. As a blind test to see the speciﬁc thermal
propertiesoftheﬂaringloops,weselectedaLOSnon-ﬂaringactiveregion(12194),extractedthree
segmentsof itsloops andanalyzedtheirthermaltreatment. Thenwecomparedthe temperature
treatment of the loops at the ﬂaring region with the loops of the non-ﬂaring region to see the
differences. Wewereeagertoobservetheprobablediscrepanciesbetweenﬂaringandnon-ﬂaring
loopsinthisrespect.
Hereweuseddataofthreeloopsoftheﬂaringactiveregion(AR11283)aroundthetimeofthe
Flare X2.1, from 22:10UT till 23:00UT on 2011 September 6, plus three loops of the non-ﬂaring
active region (AR12194), from 08:00:00UT till 09:00:00UT of 2014 October 26 (marked in ﬁgures
1 and 2). To calculate the time series of the loop temperature values, we ﬁrst extracted the loop
pixels in each image and then displayed the loop straightly for all the images in the time series
of different wavelengths. To do thermal analysis, we used the spatially-synthesized Gaussian
DEM forward-ﬁtting method founded by Aschwanden et al. (2015). We calculated the peak
temperatures for each strip of the loops. Then we applied the Lomb-Scargle method to analyze
temperatureoscillationsofthe time-seriesforeachstripof theloops.
We observed temperature oscillations which are following the transverse loop oscillations
observed by Jain et al. (2015) for the ﬂaring loops. Furthermore, the temperature oscillations in
these ﬂaring loops happen before the transverse oscillations start and continue even in the time
durationafterthe transverseoscillations decay. Asobserved,the temperatureoscillations donot
decay as rapidly as the transverse oscillations do. Conversely, the strips’ temperatures increase
attheendoftheoscillating modeandarathersensible riseisobservedintheﬁnaltemperatures
of thef-loops’segments. Therangesof the obtainedperiodsarefrom7 min. to28.4min. forthe
ﬂaringloops, andfrom8.5min. to30min. forthe non-ﬂaringloops. With theonset ofX-ﬂarein
theF-loopA,whichhasadistincttransverseoscillationintheﬂaringtimewithperiodofroughly
2 minutes and decay time of 5 minutes, a temperature oscillation is observed with periods of
roughly 10 to 28.5 minutes in different segments of this loop. And as the transverse oscillation
decaysinthisinterval,nospecialdeﬁnitedecayisobservedinitstemperatureoscillations.
The temperature periods of the ﬂaring loops are rather shorter than the temperature periods
ofthenon-ﬂaringloops. Theloopsoftheﬂaringregionshowsomeshorttemperatureoscillations
periods in which some are less than 10 minutes (Table1). These kind of short periods are more
frequently observed for the loops of the ﬂaring active region and in the case of the non-ﬂaring
ones, are very scarce. We observed that the periods of the ﬂaring loops have more diversity
than those of the non-ﬂaring ones. Based on our conﬁned observations, the non-ﬂaring loops’
periodsarelonger and their temperatures’valuesaretotally lower. Soour researchshowed that
thermal structures of the ﬂaring loops differ from the non-ﬂaring ones in the ways described
above. Astemperaturemapsshow,thetemperatureﬂuctuationsareincreasingattheﬂaringtime
and around 20 min. after, in the ﬂaring loops. This happens with some oscillations in strips’
temperature. Conversely, it seems that different strips of the non-ﬂaring loops have relatively
more similar temperatureﬂuctuations. The temperaturesare either higher in averagein the ﬂar-
ing loops’segments asexpected. The signiﬁcances ofthe periods, obtained bythe Lomb-Scargle
method, are calculated for each strip of each loop and the results show that these signiﬁcances
for the loops’ strips of the ﬂaring region are high and close to one, while for the loops’ strips of
the non-ﬂaring region are less than 0.5. Hence the detected periods in the ﬂaring loops’ strips
have high signiﬁcances (near to one) and are oscillations. Whereas the detected periods in the
non-ﬂaring loops’ strips have less signiﬁcances in comparison with the ﬂaring ones, and maybe
theyarejustﬂuctuations.
Using this method for the coronal loops showed that the oscillation modes obtained for the
temperaturesof the ﬂaring loops are very close to those of the spatial slow-mode oscillations of
the coronal loops. So the origin of temperature oscillation is probably slow-mode waves. These
kind of oscillations often occur in hot coronal loops (log(T) > 6) of active regions especially the
ones associated with small (or micro-) ﬂares (Wang et al. (2021)). The loops of our ﬂaring active
region arealso hot loops with the meantemperatureabovethis range. They also show intensity
oscillations. Hence we think the above evidence conﬁrms the slow-mode oscillations for ﬂaring
loops. The temperature of the non-ﬂaring loops are lower (log(T) < 6) and as discussed above,
webelievethattheobservedoscillation-likeperiodsinnon-ﬂaringloopsshouldbemoreprobably
relatedtothehigh amplitudeﬂuctuations.
Comparingthe loops of the ﬂaring andnon-ﬂaring regions, we observedthatthe amplitudes
of the ﬂuctuations show a discrepancy. Mean of the parameter (Max(logT)-Min(logT)) in the
FloopA, , FloopB1, FLoopB2, FloopC1, and FloopC2, are 1.21, 1.10, 0.81, 1.48, and 0.88, respec-
tively. And for non-ﬂaring region, mean of (Max(logT)-Min(logT)), are 0.81, 0.62, and 0.56, for
nonﬂoopA, B, and C respectively. Therefore the values of the quantity mean of (Max(logT)-
Min(logT))forthese non-ﬂaringloopsshowadifferencefromtheﬂaringonesandarelower.
Loops of the non-ﬂaring active region 12194 have a relatively uniform temperature at the
beginningofthetimeinterval,whichrisesslightlyatitsend. AstheSolarMonitorreportsinthe
neighborhood of this region, the ﬂaring active region 12192exists of which betweenits multiple
ﬂares, there is a c4.6 class ﬂare occurring at 9:44UT.Therefore, it could be a possible suggestion
that the abovementioned slight temperature rise in the loops of AR 12194 (in the time interval
8:00to9:00)originatedfromtheinﬂuence ofanincreaseintheenergyatthe pre-ﬂareconditions
existintheAR12192.
Hence as our study shows, the temperature of coronal loops of ﬂaring AR changes in an
oscillatory manner. Compared with these non-ﬂaring loops, the ﬂaring loops show higher tem-
peraturesonaverageandhigher oscillation periodswith higher peaksanddeepervalleys. More
accurate commentary in this respect requiresmore extensive statistical researchand broader ob-
servations.
