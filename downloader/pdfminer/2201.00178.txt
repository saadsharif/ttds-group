ABSTRACT

The technique of normal-mode coupling is a powerful tool with which to seismically image non-
axisymmetric phenomena in the Sun. Here we apply mode coupling in the Cartesian approximation to
probe steady, near-surface ﬂows in the Sun. Using Doppler cubes obtained from the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we perform inversions on mode-coupling
measurements to show that the resulting divergence and radial vorticity maps at supergranular length
scales (∼30 Mm) near the surface compare extremely well with those obtained using the Local Corre-
lation Tracking method. We ﬁnd that the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient is ≥ 0.9 for divergence ﬂows,
while ≥ 0.8 is obtained for the radial vorticity.

1. INTRODUCTION

Helioseismology is the study of the Sun’s internal structure and its properties, by means of interpreting its eﬀect
on solar oscillations (see Christensen-Dalsgaard 2002, for a review). These are resonant normal modes of the Sun,
behaving as standing waves in a cavity bounded by the solar surface and a depth that depends on the wavenumber
of the oscillation. As these waves penetrate the interior, they register information of the properties and dynamics of
the solar interior and return to the surface, where they are observed. The internal structure of the Sun can then be
retrieved through meticulous inversions of these seismic measurements.

Several important ﬂow systems on the Sun have been inferred using various global and local helioseismic methods.
Of those, the most notable global helioseismic results include inferences on the solar diﬀerential rotation, through
global mode frequency splitting (Thompson et al. 1996; Schou et al. 1998), and the resolving the neutrino problem
(Bahcall & Pinsonneault 1992). Notable local helioseismic results include imaging of the meridional ﬂow (Giles et al.
1997; Gizon et al. 2020) through time-distance helioseismology (Duvall et al. 1993), and farside imaging of active
regions (Braun & Lindsey 2001) and their near side emergence (Birch et al. 2016), through helioseismic holography
(Lindsey & Braun 2000). The recent discovery of various inertial waves (Gizon et al. 2021), including the equatorial
Rossby wave (L¨optien et al. 2018), has been achieved through local helioseismic ring-diagram analysis (Hill 1988) and
the non-helioseismic local correlation tracking (LCT, November & Simon 1988) of granulation.

In recent years, the use of global mode-coupling helioseismology (Woodard 1989; Lavely & Ritzwoller 1992) has
received attention, with many studies seeking to validate and demonstrate the importance of such a technique for
investigating numerous solar phenomena. While the derivation of the mode-coupling technique is mathematically
challenging, the data analysis is simple and utilizes all the information registered by the mode. Thus far, global
mode-coupling has been validated through observations of the meridional ﬂow (Vorontsov 2011; Woodard et al. 2013),
diﬀerential rotation (Schad & Roth 2020; Kashyap et al. 2021), global-scale convection (Woodard 2014, 2016; Hanasoge
et al. 2020; Mani & Hanasoge 2021) and Rossby modes (Hanasoge & Mandal 2019; Mandal & Hanasoge 2020; Mandal
et al. 2021). Local mode-coupling analysis in the Cartesian approximation, formulated by Woodard (2006), was
validated by Hanson et al. (2021) (hereafter H21) by examining the power-spectrum of supergranular waves and
comparing with previous time-distance studies (Langfellner et al. 2018).

Normal-mode coupling refers to the concept of expressing solar-oscillation eigenfunctions as a linear weighted combi-
nation of model-eigenfunctions (e.g., Model S Christensen-Dalsgaard 2021). The model eigenfunctions form a complete
and orthogonal basis. By design, the model Sun is spherically symmetric, adiabatic, free from rotation, magnetism and
ﬂows. In this state, the oscillations are considered to be uncoupled. The weights needed to express the solar-oscillation
eigenfunctions would then encode all the perturbations that are absent in the model. The forward problem then
reduces to relating observed seismic measurements to the perturbations that we want to infer. The surface waveﬁeld
cross-correlation is the primary measurement in the mode-coupling analysis and can be directly related to the weights
(Woodard 2016). As mode coupling is a Fourier domain technique, waveﬁelds are cross-correlated at diﬀerent spatial
and temporal frequencies, leaving us with measurements sensitive to diﬀerent quantities of interest.

In this study, we extend the spectral analysis of H21 and develop the method to produce near-surface ﬂow maps
at supergranulation length scales. A part of the formalism that was used to derive the forward model in H21 is
reworked, primarily to image steady ﬂows. Measurements are then constructed, and inversions to infer divergence ﬂow
and radial vorticity are described. We also demonstrate signal associated with supergranular ﬂow in a radial-order
coupling (p2-p2), which was not shown in H21. This helps in localizing the measurement sensitivity to the surface.
We compare our results with ﬂows obtained using the Local Correlation Tracking method on solar granules.

1.1. Forward problem

In favor of algebraic brevity, we only show crucial steps here and refer the interested reader to Appendix A for a
complete derivation of the forward problem. Working in the plane-parallel atmosphere (see also Woodard 2006), we
denote the horizontal unit vectors ex and ey in our local Cartesian domain as pointing towards west and north on the
solar surface, respectively, and ez points outwards. This approximation is valid when observing patches of the surface
that are small when compared to the solar radius. When imaging steady, near-surface ﬂows in the neighbourhood
of the supergranular scale (∼ 30 Mm), we expect the measured spectral cross-correlation signal to peak around the
horizontal wavenumber qR(cid:12) ≈ 120 (Rincon & Rieutord 2018), where q = |q| = |(qx, qy)| is the vector horizontal
wavenumber of the ﬂow. Accordingly, the goal is to relate measurements (linearly, to facilitate inversion) to the ﬂow
perturbation described in a horizontal Fourier domain. Supergranular velocities are subsonic (300-400 m/s, see Rincon
& Rieutord 2018), permitting us to model the ﬂow vector uuu = (ux, uy, uz) in the Cartesian domain like so (Unno et al.
1989; Woodard 2006)

uσ = ∇×[∇×(P ez)] + ∇×(T ez),

where P = P σ(x) and T = T σ(x) are poloidal and toroidal scalar functions, varying with position x and temporal
frequency σ. ∇ is the 3D gradient operator. While mode-coupling can easily be extended to study time-varying
perturbations (see Woodard 2016; Mani & Hanasoge 2020; Hanasoge et al. 2020; Mandal & Hanasoge 2020, for
example), here we only consider the frequency bin σ = 0, denoting the temporally averaged ﬂow over the period
of analysis. We therefore suppress σ from all terms this point forward, remembering that temporal dynamics of
perturbations may also be studied using the same model outlined in the following paragraphs. Simplifying eq 1 using
vector calculus results in

u = −∇2P ez + ∇(∂zP ) + ∇hT ×ez,

where ∇h refers to derivatives only in the horizontal direction. Mode-coupling helioseismology is performed in the
Fourier domain, and since we wish to image horizontal ﬂows on a small patch of the surface, we describe the ﬂow as a
function of horizontal wavenumber q and depth zez. Hence the poloidal and toroidal ﬂows are described by Pq(z) and
Tq(z), respectively. Furthermore, we parametrize the ﬂow along ez using basis functions f (z) (Chebyshev, B-spline,
etc). This is expressed as

fj(z) Pqj,

T ≡ Tq(z) =

fj(z) Tqj.

The ﬂow coeﬃcients Pqj and Tqj, represented by the discrete indices q and j, become ideal candidates for inversions,
where the ﬂow for each wavenumber q can be inverted for independently; parallelization in computation can thus be
exploited to expedite inversions. Note that Pqj = P ∗
−qj for the ﬂow ﬁeld to be real in the spatio-
temporal domain.

The weight factor Hω (see eq A8) is a function of frequency, capturing information about the extent of coupling between
the two modes [n, k] and [n(cid:48), k(cid:48)], where n and n(cid:48) are the radial orders of the modes, and k = |k| and k(cid:48) = |k(cid:48)| = |k + q|.
The spectral proﬁle of the mode (see eq A9) is approximated using a Lorentzian (Anderson et al. 1990). The more the
Lorentzians of the two modes overlap, the stronger the coupling. Finally, the real terms Cqj,k and Dqj,k are poloidal
and toroidal ﬂow sensitivity kernels respectively, that allow us to relate the ﬂows in question to the measurements
and are derived from the solar model see Appendix A. They possess the symmetry relation: Cqj,k = C−qj,−k and
Dqj,k = D−qj,−k (see eq A6). The kernels, as ﬂows, are expressed on the basis fj(z).

Summing over ±ω guarantees that the parity Bk,q = B∗
−k,−q (see Appendix A for derivation) is obeyed, thereby
ensuring that the ﬂow ﬁeld on the right-hand-side of eq 6 is a real physical quantity in the spatio-temporal domain.

Substituting parity and symmetry relations for all terms in the above results in eq 6. As Bk,q is constructed by a
least-squares ﬁtting, it is noteworthy that summing over −ω will also lead to improvement in its signal-to-noise as a
by-product.

1.3. Noise model

In the addition to the sensitivity kernels, a systematic background noise model is required to infer the ﬂows from
the observed B-coeﬃcients. For estimating the contribution from realization noise to the measurements, we make the
following assumptions (Gizon & Birch 2004): that the excitation of the waveﬁeld is modelled as a multivariate Gaussian
random process and the waveﬁelds are uncorrelated across wavenumber and frequency in the absence of perturbations.
Every independent realization of a mode can be understood as the output of a damped harmonic oscillator driven by a
random forcing function (see Duvall & Harvey 1986). Modes are thus generated with random phases and amplitudes
and with ﬁnite lifetimes. This stochasticity leads to realization noise in repeated measurements of mode parameters

such as its amplitude, frequency and linewidth, and consequently in Bk,q in our case. We use the same noise model
as in H21, which was motivated by the above discussion,

Gk,q ≡ (cid:104)|Bk,q|2(cid:105),

(9)

where, unlike H21, we again sum over ±ω. Gk,q is real, with the symmetry relation Gk,q = G−k,−q (see Appendix A
for explanation).

2. DATA ANALYSIS

In order to examine near surface ﬂows we build a time-series cube of Doppler images that are obtained from the
Helioseismic Magnetic Imager aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (HMI/SDO, Scherrer et al. 2012). Each image
is Postel projected, with a spatial resolution of approximately 0.48Mm, sperated in time by 45 seconds, and is tracked
at the (Snodgrass 1984) rotation rate. Here, we select a patch that is 194.4 × 194.4 Mm2 in size, tracked for 24 hours
and crosses the disk-center in the middle of observation time on the 14 Novemeber 2017 (Carrington rotation number
2197, Carrington longitude 90◦). This Dopplercube is considered as the physical waveﬁeld φ(x, y; t). The Fourier-space
waveﬁeld φω
k+q) is obtained by computing the 3D spatial and temporal
Fourier transform of the Dopplercube.

The duration of the observed region is long enough to provide suﬃcient frequency bins with which to sum over in
Eq 6, while short enough that supergranules do not substantially evolve (lifetime is purported to be 1.6 days; Rincon
& Rieutord 2018) over this period. Our observation region is close to the disk center to also avoid any contamination
from center-to-limb systematics (Zhao et al. 2012; Langfellner et al. 2015).

Maximum signal can be extracted from the weighted summation of the cross correlations (eq 5) when the spectral
proﬁles of the two modes [n, k] and [n(cid:48), k(cid:48)] closely align in ω space. This implies that their mode frequencies should be
suﬃciently close (|ωnk − ωn(cid:48)k(cid:48)| ≤ δ, the separation parameter). Since Lorentzians decay rapidly, the summation over
±ω is signiﬁcant only over a few linewidths ((cid:15), the summation parameter; see eq 7). We have empirically found and
tabulated δ in Table 1 for the radial order couplings n-n(cid:48) ∈ f-f, p1-p1, and p2-p2 (the signal strength depends only
weakly on (cid:15); we set it to 3 line widths).

Figure 1 shows that for any two adjacent ridges (adjacent n and n(cid:48)), mode frequencies ωnk and ωn(cid:48)k become spaced
farther apart with increasing wavenumber kR(cid:12). It is also known that mode linewidth Γ grows with radial orders for
a given kR(cid:12). Moreover, holding the spatial and temporal sampling rates constant, the spatial size and duration of
observation set the total number of modes within a range of kR(cid:12) (and ω/2π) that can be clearly observed, thereby
aﬀecting the quality of the seismic measurements. Owing to these factors, to maximize signal-to-noise (by visually
inspecting the power-spectrum), the parameters describing the extent of coupling over diﬀerent ranges of kR(cid:12) at ﬁxed
radial order are diﬀerent. In wavenumber, we restrict our analysis to within 200 ≤ kR(cid:12) ≤ 2000 and qR(cid:12) ≤ 300. Our
frequency range is conﬁned to span the range over which acoustic modes are observed (2 ≤ ω/2π ≤ 5 in mHz).

3. INVERSION

The ﬁnal step to producing near-surface ﬂow maps in Cartesian mode-coupling is to invert the measurements
Bk,q from the linear relation in eq 6. We describe inversion using regularized-least-squares (RLS) method here and
leave Subtractive Optimally Localized Averages (SOLA, Pijpers & Thompson 1994) for Appendix B. The methods
complement each other (see Sekii 1997), where RLS tries to minimize the misﬁt between data and model, whereas
SOLA gives better localization. For total number of modes M , RLS scales as M xJ where J is the number of basis
functions fj(z) (J (cid:28) M ; see eq 3 and section 3.1), whereas SOLA scales as M 2 (see Appendix B). For M > 5000,
computation starts to quickly become expensive for SOLA.

Mode eigenfunctions peak near the surface, with higher radial orders possessing smaller peaks in the interior. While
f-f coupling alone has enough sensitivity to probe perturbations at supergranular scales close to surface, signal is
present even in p1-p1, and p2-p2 (see Figure 3), and possibly other higher order self- and cross-couplings. Since we are
interested in only surface ﬂows, we leave higher order coupling to future work.

It bears mentioning that the slopes of the ridges in the kR(cid:12)-ν spectrum (Figure 1) increase with radial order. This
limits us to low-to-intermediate kR(cid:12) (< 1000) for these higher radial orders if we are to remain under the acoustic cut-
oﬀ frequency of 5.3mHz. It also becomes imperative to use a spatially larger observation patch to gain access to signals
from low kR(cid:12) - too large an observation region could possibly render invalid the Cartesian geometry approximation.
Regardless, in addition to performing inversions using all the couplings stacked together, we also demonstrate inversions
separately for the three couplings (see Table 2) in order to account for the full gamut of mode-coupling as a signal-rich
helioseismic technique.

For given q, the forward problem may be stated as

3.1. RLS

KU = B,

with the aim to minimize the misﬁt (cid:80)
k

||KU − B||2, with || ||2 denoting the L2 norm. Here, K is the matrix formed

by the sensitivity kernels: {Cqj,k, Dqj,k}. U is a vector composed of the ﬂow coeﬃcients: {Pqj, Tqj} and B is a vector
composed of computed B-coeﬃcients: {Bk,q}. The least-squares problem is solved simultaneously for poloidal and
toroidal ﬂow. We use B-spline basis functions as our fj(z), comprising 11 knots spaced uniformly in acoustic radius,
for both poloidal and toroidal coeﬃcients. Hence, for M modes (total number of k for a given q is M ) and 11 basis
functions for each poloidal and toroidal, the dimensions of K, U and B are thus M ×22, 22×1, and M ×1 respectively.
Normalizing both sides of eq 10 by the noise covariance Λ (a diagonal matrix with the entries Gk,q; see eq 9; dimension
M × M ) and pre-multiplying by K(cid:124),

(K(cid:124)Λ−1K)U =(K(cid:124)Λ−1)B,

U =(K(cid:124)Λ−1K)−1K(cid:124)Λ−1B.

Since the least-squares problem is typically ill-posed, we restate the minimization as (cid:80)
k

||KU − B||2 + λ||U||2 with

the regularization parameter λ which this results in a trade-oﬀ between misﬁt reduction (ﬁrst term) and solution
norm minimization (second term). Under-regularizing can lead to a solution U that is dominated by errors in the
data and on the other hand, over-regularizing may smooth or damp the solution more than necessary. Including this
regularization makes the problem better conditioned and is now deﬁned as
U = (K(cid:124)Λ−1K + λI)−1K(cid:124)Λ−1B,

(13)

where I is the identity matrix for L1 regularization. The knee-point of the L-curve (Hansen 1992), a curve formed
by plotting ||U||2 vs ||KU − B||2 for diﬀerent values of λ (see right panel of Figure 2), is usually chosen as the
regularization parameter. After successfully inverting for U, we reconstruct the ﬂow using eq 3. Results for poloidal
ﬂow Pq are shown in Figure 3.

4. LCT

To improve conﬁdence in the imaged near-surface ﬂows through mode-coupling, we compare them with ﬂows obtained
from Local Correlation Tracking method (LCT; November & Simon 1988). LCT provides surface-ﬂow maps by
examining the advection of convective granules (1.2 Mm, qR(cid:12) ≈ 3500; Hathaway et al. 2015) by underlying larger-
scale ﬂow systems. Since granules are used as tracers, which are much smaller in size than supergranules (≈ 35 Mm),
LCT is an eﬀective method (see Rieutord et al. 2001) to produce surface horizontal ﬂow maps of supergranulation.

Time series of intensity images from HMI, with the same properties of the Dopplercubes described in section 2
(tracking rate, date, location, size and duration of observed patch, spatial and temporal sampling rate), are ob-
tained and Postel projected. The horizontal ﬂows are deduced by tracking the proper motions of granules between
consecutive intensity images, which we denote as I1, I2. The LCT method selects a patch in two images each
(I1 = I1e(x−xij )2/2 sigma2
) that observe the same granule at the grid point xij = (xi, yj).
A Gaussian of width sigma allows to isolate a small region surrounding the grid point of interest as the distance
moved by granules are usually in sub-pixel regime. The convention for the direction of x is the same as described in
section 1.1. The two patches I1, I2 are then cross correlated for diﬀerent values of position shifts ∆x,

, I2 = I2e(x−xij )2/2 sigma2

Cij(∆x, ∆y) =

dx I ∗

1 (−x)I2(∆x − x).

(cid:90)

(14)

The shift ∆x = (∆x, ∆y) that maximizes the cross-correlation Cij is taken to be the proper motion of the granule.
Provided that the time diﬀerence ∆t, here 45 seconds, between the images is less than the lifetime of granules (< 10
min), the velocities are given by vx = ∆x/∆t and vy = ∆y/∆t. This exercise is repeated for all grid points in the
images I1, I2 and for each consecutive pair of images in the cube.

In practice, we use the Fourier LCT algorithm (FLCT, Fisher & Welsch 2008) for computing vx and vy. FLCT
requires the input sigma, which we set to 4 pix, that captures the extent of localization desired, and depends on the

FLCT code. vx and vy are then computed for consecutive pairs of images and are averaged over the entire day.

5. MAPS OF HORIZONTAL DIVERGENCE AND RADIAL VORTICITY

For mode-coupling, horizontal divergence (hereafter div) and radial vorticity (hereafter curl) are computed by

substituting P and T from eq 3 into eq 2 as below -

uuu(q, z) = −∇2P ez + ∇(∂zP ) + ∇hT ×ez,
xP + ∂2

We follow similar steps to those taken in Langfellner et al. (2015) for comparison of ﬂow maps with LCT. The
essential step for comparison at diﬀerent length scales is to bandpass ﬁlter the Fourier-space ﬂow around the qR(cid:12) of
interest (see Figure 4), and subsequently convert it to real space.

We seek to show comparisons (see Figures 5, 6, and 7) for qR(cid:12) = 100, 150, 200 and 250. To suﬃciently delineate
ﬂows at these length scales, we apply a Gaussian ﬁlter (see Figure 4) to ﬂows obtained from eqns 16 and 17. The
Gaussian is centered at the desired wavenumber with a half-width of 25. We then perform a 2D Fourier transform to
obtain a real-space steady-ﬂow map.

power-spectrum is then ﬁltered with a bandpass centered around qR(cid:12) = 150 (middle panel). The resulting spectra is shown in
the right panel. The units of |div|2 are in s−2. For illustration, we show the action of the ﬁlter on the power-spectrum |div|2
since it is a real quantity, but recall that it is the Fourier-space ﬂow div (a complex quantity) on which we apply the ﬁlter.

For LCT, we ﬁrst apply a Gaussian smoothing to vx and vy to average over small-scale features; the extent of
smoothing depends on the length scale qR(cid:12) to be compared with mode-coupling. div and curl are then simply
computed by

div = ∂xvx + ∂yvy,

We then perform a 2D Fourier transform on eqns 18 and 19, apply the same Gaussian ﬁlters as for mode-coupling,
and transform back to real space.

Condensing all of the above, the following sequence of operations to compare ﬂows at desired length scales are

performed for mode-coupling (M-C) and for LCT -

6. RESULTS

Table 2 summarizes the results of the comparison between ﬂows obtained from mode-coupling and LCT. Figure 5,
where we have used all the couplings to perform inversions, shows a 97% correlation between divergence ﬂows from
the two methods near supergranular scale (qR(cid:12) ≈ 100). Near-surface ﬂows are imaged most faithfully when all the
couplings are used. Since vortical ﬂows are imaged at a region near the equator, it is possible that the source of
vorticity is something other than Coriolis force. Nevertheless, there is also a very good agreement (87%) between
the vortical ﬂows as inferred from the two methods, despite being an order of magnitude weaker than the divergence
ﬂows (this is consistent with the results of Hathaway et al. 2015; Langfellner et al. 2015; Rincon et al. 2017). Due to
insuﬃcient modes for the p2-p2 case (see Table 1), we are unable to infer vortical ﬂows with conviction other than near
the supergranular scale, as can be seen from Table 2. Figure 6 also aligns with what we believe can be accomplished
through mode-coupling helioseismology - using f-f or p1-p1 alone to seismically infer near-surface divergence and vortical
ﬂows at diﬀerent scales (qR(cid:12) = 100, 150) can yield extremely good agreement with LCT. As the length scale of the
inferred ﬂow moves further away from that of supergranules (Figure 7), the demand on signal-to-noise also increases.
An adequate number of modes (and coupling strength between higher radial-orders) thus becomes a necessity to
comment substantively on the ﬂows at these scales.

for LCT (top row), and mode-coupling inversions through RLS using all the couplings (middle row), bandpass ﬁltered around
qR(cid:12) = 100 (see Figure 4). Corresponding scatter plots and correlation coeﬃcients are shown in the bottom row. We cut edges
out from the ﬂow maps and compare a circular region of diameter ≈175 Mm. The slopes of the best-ﬁt line through the scatter
plots are 0.51 for divergence and 0.01 for vorticity. The vorticity ﬂow maps are saturated to show only 40% of the maximum
values.

For both LCT and mode-coupling divergence and vorticity maps, numerous factors, arising from the associated
numerous data processing steps, can inﬂuence the ﬁnal inference of ﬂow amplitudes, making it diﬃcult to put forward
a precise statement on them. H21 reported a 60% greater amplitude for p1-p1 over f-f coupling (Figure 3 reﬂects a
similar conclusion), another element to consider when combining diﬀerent radial orders. The choice of regularization
(see right panel of Figure 2) has the potential to aﬀect the amplitudes of the inverted ﬂows to some degree. Flow
amplitudes also vary with depth, implying that diﬀerent radial orders and LCT will measure diﬀerent ﬂow averages.
This variability emerges as a natural consequence of any helioseismic inversion procedure necessitating the use of a
radial grid along which kernels and ﬂows tend to be described.

Thus, the amplitudes of the mode-coupling ﬂows (and the correlation coeﬃcient) depend upon the following factors:

• Coupling(s) used,

• Regularization parameter in the inversion,

• Smoothing applied to LCT ﬂows (indirectly; see below paragraph),

• The depth at which ﬂows are inferred.

Here, we report in Table 2 only the maximum correlation found from among the points in the radial grid close
to the surface (within ±0.5 Mm from z=0). For a desired comparison length scale qR(cid:12), we ﬁrst ﬁx the coupling(s)
and the regularization parameter to be used in the inversion. We then separately compute ﬁltered divergence and

vorticity maps for LCT for diﬀerent values of smoothing. These ﬂow maps are then compared with those obtained
from inversions at all depths in the radial grid that are within 0.5 Mm from the surface. The highest correlation
(corresponding to the above depths and smoothing) is noted and comparison ﬂow maps are plotted for the desired
qR(cid:12).

It has been shown (see De Rosa & Toomre 2004; Langfellner et al. 2015) that line-of-sight velocity from Dopplergrams
and LCT agree closely in amplitudes. But, to recapitulate, a host of factors described above can skew the amplitudes
for divergence ﬂows owing to the multi-step process involved in obtaining them. For example, there has been a history
(see, e.g., De Rosa et al. 2000; Sekii et al. 2007; Zhao et al. 2007; Langfellner et al. 2018; B¨oning et al. 2020; Korda
& ˇSvanda 2021) of using travel-time diﬀerence as only a proxy for horizontal divergence. However, Langfellner et al.

Table 2. Correlation between mode-coupling ﬂow maps and LCT maps derived from HMI Dopplergrams and intensity images,
respectively.

(2015), Birch et al. (2016) and Birch et al. (2019) use empirically determined conversion factors to align ﬂow amplitudes
from travel-time measurements with those of LCT, while acknowledging that LCT underestimates magnitudes (see
Verma et al. 2013; L¨optien et al. 2016). Even for the case of supergranulation divergence maps obtained through
ring-diagram helioseismology, Greer et al. (2016) only report normalized amplitudes.

In this work, we have developed inversions to show that the Cartesian approximation of mode-coupling can be used
with great conﬁdence to investigate ﬂows near the surface. Careful inversions of mode-coupling measurements, built
using a suﬃciently large modeset that penetrates into the deeper layers of the convection zone, can also enable probing
of the depth structure and time-evolution of supergranules, part of future work. With enough modes to improve
signal-to-noise through larger observation sizes, we suggest that Cartesian mode-coupling can ﬁnd local helioseismic
applications to investigate other depth- and time-varying features such as giant cell ﬂows (see Hathaway et al. 2013;
Hanson et al. 2020), emerging active regions, meridional ﬂows and Rossby waves.

Note the symmetry Cqj,k = C−qj,−k and Dqj,k = D−qj,−k. This coupling integral contributes to the cross-spectral
measurement between modes k and k + q From eq 8 of Woodard (2014), we write the ﬁrst-order eﬀect of ﬂow on
waveﬁeld cross-correlation as

We absorb the factor −2iω into the deﬁnition of H. Substitute eq A6 in right-hand-side of eq A7 to obtain eq 4.
The mode spectral proﬁle R is a Lorentzian, given by

where ωnk is the resonant frequency of the mode, and γnk is the mode linewidth. Eq A9 can be derived by introducing
mode damping −iωγρ as an operator in the diﬀerential equation that governs undamped, driven oscillations (see eq
5 of Hanasoge et al. 2017), and then deriving the eﬀects of ﬁrst-order perturbations to the waveﬁeld cross-correlation.
Also, the parity Hω

are established. Mode normalization N is given by

This forces N to be isotropic, i.e., to only depend on k, and not k. The sum over ω is within ﬁve linewidths of ωnk.
Note that Eq. A8 through A10 are modiﬁed from H21 to ensure parity and that ﬂow maps are real.

The three equations A8 through A10, along with the symmetry relation for kernels, and summation over ±ω, serve
to establish the parity Bσ

the real domain. Setting σ = 0 gives us the linear, invertible equation eq 6. Substituting eqns A8 through A10 into

B. SOLA INVERSIONS

Subtractive Optimally Localized Averages (SOLA, Pijpers & Thompson 1994) aims to obtain a set of weight factors
for the mode q and depth zo, which we will call αk,zo. A linear weighted sum of the measurements Bk,q in the fashion
(cid:80)
αk,zoBk,q allows for an average value of the ﬂow Pq(z) to be estimated at the depth zo. To obtain the coeﬃcients
k
αk,zo, it is assumed that a set of sensitivity kernels Kk,q(z) for the mode q can be summed up coherently to give an
’averaging kernel’ that is localized at the depth zo. Conventionally, a Gaussian centered at zo and a width ∆ is chosen
which the averaging kernel should resemble after performing inversion.

B.1. Kernels in the integral form

Since the kernels in eq A6 are manifest as coeﬃcients on a basis fj(z), we ﬁrst derive kernels that can be expressed
as a function of depth z (see Figure 8). It is convenient to derive in matrix form. Thus, with the following deﬁnitions:
P ≡ Pq(z), p ≡ Pqj, F ≡ fj(z), B ≡ Bk,q C ≡ Cqj,k and K ≡ Kk,q(z), we write (assume only poloidal ﬂow for
simplicity, the same derivations hold true for toroidal ﬂow as well)

The size of P is thus the same as the length of the radial grid z.
Now, pre-multiply by F T and integrate over z on both sides (drop the integral notation for compactness),

Now, substituting eq B12 into the forward problem eq 6,

where

P = F p

F T P = (F T F )p

p = (F T F )−1 F T P

B = Cp

As an aside, we note that averaging kernels can similarly be constructed for RLS (see section 3.1) using eqns 13
and B14.

v,

where the square matrix A = (cid:82) dz Kk,q(z)Kk(cid:48),q(z) and v = (cid:82) dz Kk,q(z)T (z, zo). Here, k(cid:48) is just a dummy index for
denoting elements in the matrix A, (k(cid:48) (cid:54)= k+q). In the last line of eq B18, we introduce regularization using an Identity
matrix I, with the regularization parameter µ - purpose being the same as that described in section 3.1. Obtaining
α thus becomes a highly expensive computationally for very large number of modes (see section 3). Substitute α
obtained from eq B18 into last line of eq B13, and (cid:80)

Inversions can similarly be performed for multiple depths by choosing suitable widths for the target Gaussians. Di-
vergence ﬂow can then be obtained from eq 16. Results are shown in Figures 9 and 10.
