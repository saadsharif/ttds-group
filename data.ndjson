Yang", "Abstract": "  Molecular maser lines are signposts of high-mass star formation, probing excitation and kinematics of very compact regions in the close environment of young stellar objects and providing useful targets for trigonometric parallax measurements. Only a few NH$_{3}$ (9,6) masers were known so far, and their origin is still poorly understood. Here we aim to find new NH$_{3}$ (9,6) masers to provide a better observational basis to study their role in high-mass star-forming regions. We carried out NH$_{3}$ (9,6) observations toward Cepheus A and G34.26$+$0.15 with the Effelsberg-100 m telescope and the Karl G. Janksy Very Large Array. We discovered new NH$_{3}$ (9,6) masers in Cep A and G34.26$+$0.25, which increases the number of high-mass star-forming regions hosting NH$_{3}$ (9,6) masers from five to seven. Long term monitoring (20 months) at Effelsberg shows that the intensity of the (9,6) maser in G34.26$+$0.25 is decreasing, while the Cep A maser remains stable. Compared to the Effelsberg data and assuming linear variations between the epochs of observation, the JVLA data indicate no missing flux. This suggests that the NH$_3$ (9,6) emission arises from single compact emission regions that are not resolved by the interferometric measurements. As JVLA imaging shows, the NH$_{3}$ (9,6) emission in Cep A originates from a sub-arcsecond sized region, slightly to the west of the peak position of the 1.36\\,cm continuum object, HW2. In G34.26$+$0.25, three NH$_{3}$ (9,6) maser spots are observed: one is close to the head of the cometary ultracompact \\h2 region C and the other two are emitted from a compact region to the west of the hypercompact \\h2 region A. The newly found (9,6) masers appear to be related to outflows. Higher angular resolution of JVLA and VLBI observations are needed to provide more accurate positions and constraints for pumping scenarios.

{"Title": "The Formation of Intermediate Mass Black Holes in Galactic Nuclei", "Authors": "Sanaea C. Rose, Smadar Naoz, Re'em Sari, Itai Linial", "Abstract": "  Most stellar evolution models predict that black holes (BHs) should not exist above approximately $50-70$ M$_\\odot$. However, recent LIGO/Virgo detections indicate the existence of BHs with masses at and above this threshold. We suggest that massive BHs, including intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), can form in galactic nuclei through collisions between stellar-mass black holes and the surrounding main-sequence stars. Considering dynamical processes such as collisions, mass segregation, and relaxation, we find that this channel can be quite efficient, forming IMBHs as massive as $10^4$ M$_\\odot$. Our results suggest that massive black holes and IMBHs may be ubiquitous in galactic centres. This formation channel also has implications for observations. Collisions between stars and BHs can produce electromagnetic signatures, for example, from x-ray binaries and tidal disruption events. Additionally, formed through this channel, both black holes in the mass gap and IMBHs can merge with the supermassive black hole at the center of a galactic nucleus through gravitational waves. These gravitational wave events are extreme and intermediate mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs and IMRIs, respectively).

Using data collected from the Kepler space telescope, \nwe sequentially re-binned data three times to investigate the SNR improvement of lower frequency \n(< 17 \u00b5Hz) variability in white dwarf KIC 8626021. We found that the SNR at approximately 5.8 \n\u00b5Hz greatly improved through this process, and we postulate that this frequency is linked to the \nrotation of KIC 8626021. \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nFirst detected in 1862, white dwarfs long posed a mystery for early observers. When the \ncompanion to Sirius was detected, apparent contradictions concerning the mass, luminosities, and \ndensities baffled astronomers. Lacking full understanding of atomic structures and the energy \nstates of electrons, these early researchers believed white dwarfs too dense to exist. However, new \ndiscoveries at the turn of the 20th century explained the existence of these stars, and between the \nworld wars white dwarfs were increasingly studied and modeled (Holberg, 2009). \nAs stars age, those that lack the mass to become neutron stars and black holes become \nwhite dwarf stars, representing 98% of the stars in our galaxy (Winget & Kepler, 2008).  They are \ncomposed of a core of carbon and oxygen ions that slowly cools over billions of years, and the \nlight emanating from these stars is a result of thermal energy. White dwarf stars are no longer \nsupported against the force of gravity by fusion, so the stars collapse into an electron-degenerate \nstate where the electrons in the carbon and oxygen atoms occupy the lowest energy levels. As two \nelectrons  cannot  occupy  the  same  quantum  state,  Pauli  repulsion  keeps  white  dwarfs  from \ncollapsing entirely. \nFor many years, accurate detection of light variability in white dwarfs was difficult due to \na lack of adequate instruments. However, the launch of the Kepler space telescope in 2009 made \ncapturing the light of distant stars much more efficient and effective (Basri et al., 2010). Kepler \nwas initially developed with the intention of surveying our region of the Milky Way galaxy in \norder to find potentially habitable planets. The purpose of the mission was to identify key traits for \nsuch planets by determining the number of planets in habitable zones, the sizes and shapes of orbits, \nand the characteristics of the stars being orbited. Over the lifespan of its first mission, Kepler \nobserved  approximately  1.5  x  105  stars  (Johnson,  2018),  affording  scientists  excellent \nopportunities to research stellar variability. Due to the loss of a second reaction wheel in 2013, \nNASA  developed  the  K2  mission,  a  way  to  prolong  Kepler\u2019s  assistance  to  astronomy  and \nastrophysics. \nUtilizing Kepler\u2019s ability to maintain three-dimensional control, NASA proceeded to use \nthe telescope to collect photometry data of certain sections of our galaxy, although the number of \ntargets was significantly reduced. In addition, the K2 mission was designed to be community-\noriented, with the scientific community having an influence on the fields observed and serving as \nthe analysts of the vast amounts of data being received (Howell et al., 2014). Although Kepler was \ndeactivated in 2018, the data used in this paper came from observations during 2010 and 2012 of \nwhite dwarf KIC 8626021 and was obtained from the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Operations \nCenter (KASOC).    3 \nThe DBV white dwarf KIC 8626021 has an atmosphere rich in helium. Building upon \nprevious studies, this research investigated novel techniques of analyzing variability in white \ndwarfs. The dwarf KIC 8626021 was chosen due to the large amount of preexisting research on \nthe star, allowing for the validation of results using our methods. KIC 8626021 has an effective \ntemperature of 29,700 K, log g = 7.890, and mass of 0.56 M (C\u00f3rsico, 2020). Other research \n\u2609 \nhas found that this white dwarf is the DBV with the highest known temperature, and its helium \nlayer is the thinnest (Bischoff-Kim et al., 2015). Despite the long-cadence light curve being too \nnoisy to draw many conclusions, other FTs of short-cadence data have been performed to find \nvariability in the dwarf. Analyses at high frequencies of KIC 8626021 yielded pulsations with \nfrequencies of 4309.89 \u00b5Hz, 5073.26 \u00b5Hz, 3681.87 \u00b5Hz, 3294.22 \u00b5Hz and 2658.85 \u00b5Hz \n(\u00d8stensen et al., 2011). These findings confirm the classification of the white dwarf as a V777 \nHerculis, although our research focuses on low frequencies using long-cadence data. \n \n \n \nMethods \n \nAll data were downloaded from the KASOC database, and the long-cadence (data \nsampled approximately every thirty minutes) measurements of Corrected Flux (ppm) were \nanalyzed. All computations were made in Wolfram Mathematica and Microsoft Excel, and FTs \nwere performed in Mathematica. The re-binning process consisted of summing adjacent light \ncurve data points in each quarter, therefore doubling the sampling interval from 0.5 hour to one \nhour, and then repeating this process on the data sample for a total of three times. In addition, a \nsignificant detection was defined as being 3  above the mean of the relative flux, and 0 on the \ngraphs below represents this 3  cutoff. (Koch, D. G., 2010), (Wolfram Research, Inc., 2021). To \nfind the SNR, we converted to decibels. Usi\ud835\udf48ng these SNRs, we were able to easily identify \nimprovement in signal strength\ud835\udf48. \n \n \nResults \n \n  Figure 1 presents the lightcurves constructed for quarters seven (Q7) and thirteen (Q13), \nwith corrected flux magnitude (ppm) plotted versus time (Julian days). Figure 2 presents the FTs \nof the first iteration and three successive re-bins for Q7, while Figure 3 presents the FTs of the \nsame for Q13. \n  Tables 1 and 2 both show the hypothesized frequency corresponding to the rotation of \nKIC 8626021 that is found in the FTs of the first iteration and subsequent re-bins for Q7 and \nQ13. Tables 3 and 4 show all data values < 17 \u00b5Hz found in the first iterations and re-bins of Q7 \nand Q13. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    4 \n \n \nFIG. 1: Pictured top is the light curve constructed for Q7, below is the light curve for Q13. Q7 \nlasted from September 24 \u2013 December 13, 2010, and Q13 was from March 29 \u2013 June 23, 2012. \nBoth graphs were constructed by plotting corrected flux magnitude (flux corrected for \ninstrumental artifacts) versus time in Excel, and gaps in the data were filled in by interpolating \nbetween points. Q7 had forty-three interpolated points, and Q13 had sixty-six. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    5 \n \n \nFIG. 2: The graphs show the initial FTs of Q7, and then the FTs of the three successive re-bins of \nthe light curve data. The significant frequencies of 5.886 \u00b5Hz and 5.889 \u00b5Hz are circled. The \ndisappearance of the frequency in the last FT is most likely a byproduct of the method, and the \nspurious frequency of 5.464 \u00b5Hz in the last FT most probably represents an artifact of the re-\nbinning process. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    6 \n \n \n \nFIG. 3: The graphs show the initial FT of Q13, and then the FTs of the three successive re-bins \nof the light curve data.

In \naddition, in the third re-bin, the frequencies 11.641 \u00b5Hz and 16.823 \u00b5Hz rise above 3  and are \nnearly perfect integer multiples of 5.787 \u00b5Hz.

However, this presents an opportunity to \nverify our results with the work of research groups that analyzed short-cadence data.With the \ndata analyzed, the lower frequencies between 5-6 \u00b5Hz emerged. After finding the average of the \nperiods and accounting for a 1  margin of error, our research hypothesizes that the rotation \nperiod of KIC 8626021 is 1.99 \u00b1 0.02 days. Other short-cadence research has found the rotation \nperiod to be 1.8 \u00b1 0.4 days, by\ud835\udf48 analyzing the structures of independent modes (Bischoff-Kim et \nal., 2015). Other calculated periods of rotation have been \u2248 1.7 days (\u00d8stensen et al., 2011), and \nthese periods indicate that the more precise significant period identified through our re-binning \nrelates to the rotation of the white dwarf.   \nThrough the re-binning process, the SNR clearly improves for both quarters, and for Q7 it \nimproves by approximately 1.3 dB, except for the last data re-bin. In the last re-bin, the previous    10 \nsignificant frequency disappears, which becomes increasingly likely after successive re-binning \nprocesses. The frequency 5.464 \u00b5Hz rises as another significant frequency; however, we believe \nthat this new frequency is simply an artifact of the re-binning process. In Q13, we saw SNR \nimprovement ranging from 1.1 dB to 1.3 dB.  \nThrough the re-binning process, more lines, or significant frequencies, appeared above \nthe 3  cutoff, particularly at lower frequencies. These findings suggest that as an alternative to \nshort-cadence analysis, the re-binning process of long-cadence data can be used to identify \nsignif\ud835\udf48icant lower frequencies in white dwarfs. The methods we used are also simple and \nreplicable, which allows even those with less experience to quickly analyze the large amounts of \ndata being collected by orbiting telescopes, such as the currently active TESS (Transiting \nExoplanet Survey Satellite) telescope. \nThe presence of possible harmonics in the third re-bin of Q13 also indicates the possible \npresence of a previously unseen starspot in KIC 8626021 caused by magnetic activity. These \nspots are darker, cooler, and modulate stellar light curves, and with confirmation of its existence, \nthe harmonic frequencies can be used to calculate the spot\u2019s rotation rate, size, latitude, and \ncontrast (Santos et al., 2017). Using the process of re-binning, a starspot signal, previously \ndominated by noise, may have been discovered.     11 \nAcknowledgments \n \nWe wish to thank Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania for its continued support of our \nresearch. \nThis paper includes data collected by the Kepler mission and obtained from the MAST \ndata archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI).

Our model includes inertial and gravitational torques between interior regions,\nand viscous and electromagnetic (EM) coupling at the boundaries of the \ufb02uid core. We show\nthat the coupling between Mercury\u2019s interior regions is su\ufb03ciently strong that the obliquity of\nthe mantle spin axis deviates from that of a rigid planet by no more than 0.01 arcmin. The man-\ntle obliquity decreases with increasing inner core size, but the change between a large and no\ninner core is limited to 0.015 arcmin. EM coupling is stronger than viscous coupling at the in-\nner core boundary and, if the core magnetic \ufb01eld strength is above 0.3 mT, locks the \ufb02uid and\nsolid cores into a common precession motion. Because of the strong gravitational coupling be-\ntween the mantle and inner core, the larger the inner core is, the more this co-precessing core\nis brought into an alignment with the mantle, and the more the obliquity of the polar moment\nof inertia approaches that expected for a rigid planet. The misalignment between the polar mo-\nment of inertia and mantle spin axis increases with inner core size, but is limited to 0.007 ar-\ncmin. Our results imply that the measured obliquities of the mantle spin axis and polar mo-\nment of inertia should coincide at the present-day level of measurement errors, and cannot be\ndistinguished from the obliquity of a rigid planet.\nPlain language summary: The plane of Mercury\u2019s orbit around the Sun is slowly precess-\ning about an axis \ufb01xed in space. This entrains a precession of the spin axis of Mercury at the\nsame rate, an equilibrium known as a Cassini state. The angle between the spin axis and the\nnormal to the orbital plane is known as the obliquity and remains \ufb01xed. Observations have con-\n\ufb01rmed that Mercury\u2019s obliquity matches, within measurement errors, the theoretical predic-\ntion based on an entirely rigid planet. However, we know that Mercury has a large metallic core\nwhich is liquid, although the central part may be solid. In this work, we investigate how the\npresence of a \ufb02uid and solid core a\ufb00ect the Cassini state of Mercury. We show that the inter-\nnal coupling between the solid core, \ufb02uid core and the mantle is su\ufb03ciently strong that the obliq-\nuity of the mantle does not depart from that of a rigid planet by more than 0.01 arcmin, an\no\ufb00set smaller than the present-day error in measurements. We also show that the larger the\nsolid inner core is, the more the planet behaves as if it were precessing as an entirely rigid body.\n1 Introduction\nMercury is expected to be in a Cassini state (Figure 1) whereby its orbit normal and spin-\nsymmetry axis are both coplanar with, and precess about, the normal to the Laplace plane [Colombo,\n1966; Peale, 1969, 2006]. The orientation of the Laplace plane varies on long timescales, but\nits present-day orientation can be reconstructed from ephemerides data [Yseboodt and Margot,\n2006; Baland et al., 2017]. Likewise, the rate of precession is also not observed directly, but is\nreconstructed by ephemerides data. The latest estimate is a retrograde precession period of 325,513\nyr with an inclination angle of I =8.5330\u25e6 between the orbit and Laplace plane normals [Ba-\nland et al., 2017]. Measurements of the obliquity \u03b5 , de\ufb01ned as the angle of misalignment be-\nm\ntween the spin-symmetry axis and the orbit normal, have been obtained by di\ufb00erent techniques,\nincluding ground based radar observations [Margot et al., 2007, 2012], and stereo digital ter-\nrain images [Stark et al., 2015a] and radio tracking data [Mazarico et al., 2014; Verma and Mar-\ngot, 2016; Genova et al., 2019; Konopliv et al., 2020] from the MErcury Surface Space ENvi-\nronment GEochemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft. Within measurement errors,\nall techniques yield an obliquity which is coplanar with the orbit and Laplace plane normals\nand consistent with a Cassini state. Furthermore, the observed obliquity angle (2.042\u00b10.08\n\u20132\u2013Con\ufb01dential manuscript submitted to JGR-Planets\n\u00eaL \u00eaI\n3 3\nI \u00eap\n\u03b5\nm 3 \u00eaL\n\u03a9 3\np\n\u00eaI\n3\npleaqnueatorial  I ansocdeen odfi nogrbit\nM\norbital plane odrirbeictatilon\n\u03b5\ndescending m\nnode of equator S\nI\ndescending\nnode of orbit\nFigure 1.

Angles are not drawn to scale.\narcmin [Margot et al., 2012], 2.029\u00b10.085 arcmin [Stark et al., 2015a] and 1.968\u00b10.027 [Gen-\nova et al., 2019] to list a few) matches that expected if Mercury occupies Cassini state 1.\nThe prediction of Mercury\u2019s obliquity is based on the assumption that the whole planet\nprecesses as a single body. However, we know that Mercury has a \ufb02uid core from two main lines\nof evidence. First, Mercury\u2019s large scale magnetic \ufb01eld is intrinsic, and must be maintained by\ndynamo action [Anderson et al., 2011, 2012; Johnson et al., 2012]. This requires \ufb02uid motion\nin its metallic core, and hence that Mercury\u2019s core is at least partially liquid. Second, the ob-\nserved amplitude of the 88-day longitudinal libration is approximately twice as large as that\nexpected if Mercury were librating as a rigid body [Margot et al., 2007, 2012; Stark et al., 2015a].\nThis indicates that it is only the mantle that librates, and that the outer part of the core is \ufb02uid.\nThese evidences do not necessarily imply that the whole of Mercury\u2019s core is \ufb02uid, but only that\nits outermost part must be. A solid inner core may have nucleated at the centre although its\nsize is not well constrained. Inner core growth leads to planetary contraction, and the inferred\nradial contraction of \u223c7 km since the late heavy bombardment [Byrne et al., 2014] places an\napproximate limit of 800 km on the inner core radius [Grott et al., 2011]. However, the inner\ncore could be larger if a signi\ufb01cant fraction of its growth occurred earlier in Mercury\u2019s history.\n\u20133\u2013Con\ufb01dential manuscript submitted to JGR-Planets\nWith a \ufb02uid core, and possibly a solid inner core, the observed obliquity \u03b5 re\ufb02ects the\nm\norientation of the spin-symmetry axis of the precessing mantle and crust alone. Neglecting dis-\nsipation, and at equilibrium in the Cassini state, the spin axis of the \ufb02uid core and the spin-\nsymmetry axis of the inner core should both also precess about the normal to the Laplace plane\nin a retrograde direction with a period of 325,513 yr. Both of these axes should also lie in the\nplane that de\ufb01nes the equilibrium Cassini state [e.g. Dumberry and Wieczorek, 2016], although\ntheir obliquity angles may be di\ufb00erent than \u03b5 . Whether the spin axis of the \ufb02uid core is brought\nm\ninto an alignment with the mantle obliquity depends primarily on the pressure torque (also re-\nferred to as the inertial torque) exerted by the centrifugal force of the rotating \ufb02uid core on the\nmisaligned elliptical shape of the core-mantle boundary (CMB) [Poincar\u00b4e, 1910]. The more \ufb02at-\ntened the CMB is, the stronger the pressure torque is, and the more the \ufb02uid core is entrained\ninto a co-precession at a similar obliquity to that of the mantle. The \ufb02attening of Mercury\u2019s\nCMB is not known. But if one assumes that the topography of the CMB coincides with an equipo-\ntential surface at hydrostatic equilibrium with the imposed frozen-in mass anomalies in the up-\nper mantle and crust, then the pressure torque at the CMB is su\ufb03cient to bring the \ufb02uid core\ninto a close alignment with the mantle [Peale et al., 2014]. The spin axis of the \ufb02uid core is not\nexpected to be exactly aligned with the spin-symmetry axis of the mantle, but su\ufb03ciently close\nthat the resulting mantle obliquity does not di\ufb00er much from that of a single body planet. Fur-\nthermore, viscous and electromagnetic (EM) coupling at the CMB can further restrict the mis-\nalignment between the mantle and core [Peale et al., 2014].\nIf an inner core is present, its obliquity angle is determined by the sum of the torques act-\ning on it. This includes the gravitational torque from the Sun acting on its tilted \ufb01gure, anal-\nogous to the torque applied on the tilted mantle that sets the obliquity \u03b5 . In addition, the\nm\ntilt of the inner core also depends on the gravitational torque imposed by the mantle and the\npressure torque at the inner core boundary (ICB) imposed by the \ufb02uid core. If the mantle grav-\nitational torque dominates, the inner core tilt is expected to remain closely aligned with the\nmantle. Conversely, if the pressure torque at the ICB is the largest, the inner core should in-\nstead be closely aligned with the spin axis of the \ufb02uid core. A strong viscous and/or EM cou-\npling at the ICB should also enforce a closer alignment between the rotation vectors of the in-\nner core and \ufb02uid core.\nIt is on the basis of the observed mantle obliquity that the polar moment of inertia of Mer-\ncury is inferred [e.g. Peale, 1976; Margot et al., 2018]. Inherent in this calculation is the built-\nin assumption that the mantle obliquity does not deviate from that of a rigid planet by a sub-\nstantial amount. However, the recent study by Peale et al. [2016] suggests that the inner core\ncan be misaligned from the mantle by a few arcmin and that a large inner core can perturb the\norientation of the spin vector of the mantle by as much as 0.1 arcmin. This challenges the as-\nsumption that the observed obliquity re\ufb02ects the orientation of the whole planet.\nFurthermore, if a large inner core is misaligned with the mantle, then the mantle spin axis\ndoes not coincide with the orientation of the polar moment of inertia of the whole planet. This\ncan introduce a systematic o\ufb00set between di\ufb00erent types of obliquity measurements. Those based\non tracking topographic features [Margot et al., 2007, 2012; Stark et al., 2015a] capture the obliq-\nuity of the mantle spin axis. While those based on the orientation of the gravity \ufb01eld [Mazarico\net al., 2014; Verma and Margot, 2016; Genova et al., 2019; Konopliv et al., 2020] are instead\ntied to the orientation of the principal moment of inertia of the whole planet. An o\ufb00set of the\nobliquity of the mantle spin axis with respect to the gravity \ufb01eld could be used to constrain the\nsize of the inner core, even though this is di\ufb03cult to do at present because the di\ufb00erent esti-\nmates of the obliquity of the gravity \ufb01eld do not match well with one another.\n\u20134\u2013Con\ufb01dential manuscript submitted to JGR-Planets\nThere is thus a signi\ufb01cant interest in properly assessing how the presence of a solid in-\nner core at the centre of Mercury may a\ufb00ect its Cassini state equilibrium. Here, we present a\nmodel of Mercury\u2019s Cassini state that comprises a \ufb02uid core and solid inner core. The model\nis an adaptation of a similar model developed to study the Cassini state of the Moon [Dumb-\nerry and Wieczorek, 2016; Stys and Dumberry, 2018; Organowski and Dumberry, 2020]. The\nspeci\ufb01c questions that motivate our study are the following. First, we want to determine how\nlarge the misaligned obliquities of the \ufb02uid core and solid inner core can be and how they de-\npend on model parameters. Second, we want to assess by how much the mantle obliquity may\ndi\ufb00er from that of an entirely rigid Mercury, and third, by how much the obliquities of the spin-\nsymmetry axis of the mantle and gravity \ufb01eld may di\ufb00er.\n2 Theory\n2.1 The interior structure of Mercury\nOur model of Mercury consists of four layers of uniform density: a solid inner core, a \ufb02uid\nouter core, a solid mantle, and a thin crust. The outer radii of each of these layers, are denoted\nby r , r , r , and R, and their densities by \u03c1 , \u03c1 , \u03c1 , and \u03c1 , respectively. The inner core ra-\ns f m s f m c\ndius r corresponds to the ICB radius, the \ufb02uid core radius r to the CMB radius, and R=\ns f\n2439.36 km to the planetary radius of Mercury. Compressibility e\ufb00ects from increasing pres-\nsure with depth are not negligible in the core of Mercury. However adopting uniform densities\nsimpli\ufb01es the analytical expressions of the model while still capturing the \ufb01rst order rotational\ndynamics. Uniform densities were also adopted by Peale et al. [2016] and following the same\nstrategy facilitates comparisons between our results.\nWe build our interior model as detailed in Peale et al. [2016]. We \ufb01rst specify r , \u03c1 (or\ns s\na density contrast at the ICB), the crustal density \u03c1 and crustal thickness h=R\u2212r . The\nc m\nthree unknowns r , \u03c1 and \u03c1 are then solved such that the interior model is consistent with\nf f m\nthe known mass M and chosen values of the moments of inertia of the whole planet C and that\nof the mantle and crust C .\nm\nEach layer is triaxial in shape. We denote the polar \ufb02attening (or geometrical ellipticity)\nby (cid:15) , de\ufb01ned as the di\ufb00erence between the mean equatorial and polar radii, divided by the mean\ni\nspherical radius. Likewise, we denote the equatorial \ufb02attening by the variable \u03be , de\ufb01ned as the\ni\ndi\ufb00erence between the maximum and minimum equatorial radii, divided by the mean spher-\nical radius. As above, we use the subscript i = s, f, m and r, to denote the polar or equa-\ntorial \ufb02attenings at the ICB, CMB, crust-mantle boundary (CrMB), and surface.\nThe measured polar and equatorial \ufb02attenings are taken from Perry et al. [2015] and their\nnumerical values are given in Table 1. We then assume that the ICB and CMB are both at hy-\ndrostatic equilibrium with the imposed gravitational potential induced by the \ufb02attenings at the\nCrMB and surface. The \ufb02attenings at all interior boundaries are speci\ufb01ed such that they are\nconsistent with the observed degree 2 spherical harmonic coe\ufb03cients of gravity J and C ; their\n2 22\nnumerical values are given in Table 1. Speci\ufb01cally, J and C are connected to the principal\n2 22\nmoments of inertia of Mercury (C >B >A) and to the polar and equatorial \ufb02attenings by\nJ = C\u2212A\u00af = 8\u03c0 1 (cid:2)(\u03c1 \u2212\u03c1 )r5(cid:15) +(\u03c1 \u2212\u03c1 )r5(cid:15) +(\u03c1 \u2212\u03c1 )r5 (cid:15) +\u03c1 R5(cid:15) (cid:3) , (1a)\n2 MR2 15MR2 s f s s f m f f m c m m c r\nC = B\u2212A = 8\u03c0 1 (cid:2)(\u03c1 \u2212\u03c1 )r5\u03be +(\u03c1 \u2212\u03c1 )r5\u03be +(\u03c1 \u2212\u03c1 )r5 \u03be +\u03c1 R5\u03be (cid:3) .

The orbital period is\n87.96935 day and the sidereal rotation period is 58.64623 day [Stark et al., 2015b]. These de-\n\ufb01ne the mean motion n = 2\u03c0/87.96935 day\u22121 and the sidereal frequency \u2126 = 2\u03c0/58.64623\no\nday\u22121, with \u2126 =1.5n. Mercury\u2019s rotational state is also characterized by a Cassini state whereby\no\nthe orientations of the orbit normal (e\u02c6I) and of the mantle symmetry axis (e\u02c6p) are both copla-\n3 3\nnar with, and precess about, the normal to the Laplace plane (e\u02c6L). The orientation of the Laplace\n3\nplane varies on long timescales, but it can be taken as invariable in inertial space for our present\npurpose. The Cassini state of Mercury is illustrated in Figure 1. The angle between e\u02c6L and e\u02c6I\n3 3\nis the orbital inclination I =8.5330\u25e6 [Baland et al., 2017], the angle between e\u02c6I and e\u02c6p is the\n3 3\nobliquity \u03b5 and the angle between e\u02c6L and e\u02c6p is \u03b8 = I +\u03b5 . The precession of e\u02c6I and e\u02c6p\nm 3 3 p m 3 3\nabout the Laplace pole is retrograde with frequency \u2126 =2\u03c0/325,513 yr\u22121 [Baland et al., 2017].\np\nThe mantle and crust are welded together and form a single rotating region which we re-\nfer to as the \u2018mantle\u2019 in the context of our rotational model. The rotation and symmetry axes\nof the mantle are expected to remain in close alignment, but they do not coincide exactly. We\nde\ufb01ne the rotation rate vector of the mantle by \u2126, and its misalignment from e\u02c6p by an angle\n3\n\u03b8 . Note that \u03b8 (cid:28) \u03b5 and it is often the spin axis of Mercury which is used to de\ufb01ne the\nm m m\nobliquity \u03b5 [e.g. Baland et al., 2017]. If Mercury were an entirely rigid planet, e\u02c6p and \u2126 would\nm 3\ncharacterize the symmetry and rotation axes of the whole of Mercury, not just its mantle, and\nthe angles I, \u03b5 and \u03b8 would completely describe the Cassini state. The presence of a \ufb02uid\nm m\nouter core and solid inner core require three additional orientation vectors and angles. The sym-\nmetry axis of the inner core is de\ufb01ned by unit vector e\u02c6s and its misalignment from e\u02c6p by an\n3 3\nangle \u03b8 . The rotation vectors of the \ufb02uid core and inner core are de\ufb01ned as \u2126 and \u2126 , re-\nn f s\nspectively, and their misalignment from the rotation vector of the mantle \u2126 are de\ufb01ned by an-\ngles \u03b8 and \u03b8 (see Figure 2a). The rotation and symmetry axes of the inner core remain in close\nf s\nalignment, so \u03b8 \u2248\u03b8 . To be formal in our de\ufb01nition of the di\ufb00erent angles of misalignment,\nn s\nfor I de\ufb01ned positive as depicted on Figure 2a, all angles are de\ufb01ned positive in the clockwise\ndirection.\nAt equilibrium in the Cassini state, the three orientation vectors (e\u02c6I, e\u02c6p, e\u02c6s) and three\n3 3 3\nrotation vectors (\u2126, \u2126 , \u2126 ) are forced to precess about e\u02c6L at the same frequency. If we ne-\nf s 3\nglect dissipation, all vectors lie on the same plane, which we refer to as the Cassini plane. Viewed\nin inertial space, the Cassini plane is rotating in a retrograde direction at frequency \u2126 . Viewed\np\nin the frame attached to the mantle rotating at sidereal frequency \u2126 , the Cassini plane is ro-\no\ntating in a retrograde direction at frequency \u03c9\u2126 (see Figure 2b), where \u03c9, expressed in cycles\no\nper Mercury day, is equal to\n\u03c9 =\u22121\u2212\u03b4\u03c9cos(\u03b8 ). (5)\np\nThe factor \u03b4\u03c9 = \u2126 /\u2126 = 4.933\u00d710\u22127 is the Poincar\u00b4e number, expressing the ratio of the\np o\nforced precession to sidereal rotation frequencies. The invariance of the Laplace plane normal\nas seen in the mantle frame is expressed as\nd\ne\u02c6L+\u2126\u00d7e\u02c6L =0, (6)\ndt 3 3\nor equivalently, by Equation (19e) of Stys and Dumberry [2018],\n\u03c9sin(\u03b8 )+sin(\u03b8 +\u03b8 )=0. (7)\np m p\n\u20138\u2013Con\ufb01dential manuscript submitted to JGR-Planets\nThis expresses a formal connection between \u03b8 and \u03b8 which is independent of the interior struc-\np m\nture of Mercury. Using Equation (5) and cos(\u03b8 )\u21921, this connection can be rewritten as\nm\nsin(\u03b8 )=\u03b4\u03c9 sin(\u03b8 ). (8)\nm p\nand thus the relative amplitudes of \u03b8 and \u03b8 depend of the Poincar\u00b4e number \u03b4\u03c9.\nm p\nTo investigate Mercury\u2019s response to the gravitational torque from the Sun, we take ad-\nvantage of the framework developed in Mathews et al. [1991] to model the forced nutations of\nEarth [see also Mathews et al., 2002; Dehant and Mathews, 2015]. This model takes into ac-\ncount the pressure torque (also referred to as the inertial torque) that results when the spin axis\nof the \ufb02uid core is misaligned from the symmetry axes of the elliptical surfaces of the CMB and\nICB. It also includes the gravitational torque exerted on the inner core when it is misaligned\nwith the mantle. Electromagnetic and viscous torques at both the CMB and ICB have been\nincorporated into the framework [e.g Bu\ufb00ett, 1992; Bu\ufb00ett et al., 2002; Mathews and Guo, 2005;\nDeleplace and Cardin, 2006]. The framework was adapted to model the Cassini state of the Moon\nin Dumberry and Wieczorek [2016] and further developed in Stys and Dumberry [2018] and Organowski\nand Dumberry [2020]. We adapt it here to capture the Cassini state of Mercury.\nBecause the forced precession period is much longer than the rotation and orbital peri-\nods of Mercury, the gravitational solar torque that is relevant to the Cassini state is the mean\ntorque averaged over one orbit. This mean torque is perpendicular to the Cassini plane, point-\ning in the same direction as the vector connecting the Sun to the descending node of Mercury\u2019s\norbit in Figure 1. Hence, viewed from the mantle frame, the orientation of this mean torque\nis periodic, rotating at frequency \u03c9\u2126 . Setting the equatorial directions e\u02c6p and e\u02c6p to correspond\no 1 2\nto the real and imaginary axes of the complex plane, respectively, we can write the equatorial\ncomponents of this periodic applied torque in a compact form as\n\u0393 (t)+i\u0393 (t)=\u2212i\u0393\u02dc(\u03c9) exp[i\u03c9\u2126 t], (9)\n1 2 o\nwhere \u0393\u02dc(\u03c9) represents the amplitude of the torque at frequency \u03c9\u2126 . In response to this torque,\no\nthe axes de\ufb01ning all angles (\u03b8 , \u03b5 , \u03b8 , \u03b8 , \u03b8 , \u03b8 ) as viewed in the mantle frame are also ro-\np m m f s n\ntating at frequency \u03c9\u2126 (see Figure 2). The longitudinal direction of each of these angles at\no\na speci\ufb01c time t can then also be written in the equatorial complex plane and is proportional\nto exp[i\u03c9\u2126 t]. For instance, the two equatorial time-dependent components \u03b8 and \u03b8 of the\no m1 m2\nangle \u03b8 , as seen in the mantle frame, can be written as\nm\n\u03b8 (t)+i\u03b8 (t)=m\u02dc exp[i\u03c9\u2126 t], (10a)\nm1 m2 o\nwhere\nm\u02dc \u2261m\u02dc(\u03c9)=Re[m\u02dc]+iIm[m\u02dc], (10b)\nis the amplitude at frequency \u03c9\u2126 . Equivalent de\ufb01nitions apply for all other angles, with the\no\nconnection as follows:\n\u03b8 \u21d4m\u02dc , \u03b8 \u21d4m\u02dc , \u03b8 \u21d4m\u02dc , \u03b8 \u21d4n\u02dc , \u03b8 \u21d4p\u02dc, \u03b5 \u21d4\u03b5\u02dc . (11)\nm f f s s n s p m m\nThe notation m\u02dc, m\u02dc , m\u02dc , n\u02dc follows that introduced in the original model of Mathews et al. [1991].\nf s s\nNote that all tilded amplitudes are complex: their imaginary part re\ufb02ects the out-of-phase re-\nsponse to the applied torque as a result of dissipation, for instance from viscous or EM coupling\n\u20139\u2013Con\ufb01dential manuscript submitted to JGR-Planets\nat the boundaries of the \ufb02uid core. In the absence of dissipation, all tilded variables are purely\nreal. We concentrate our analysis in this work on the real part of the solutions, which corre-\nsponds to the mutual alignment of these \ufb01ve rotation angles in the Cassini plane. As such, \u03b5\u02dc\nm\ncorresponds to the observed obliquity of the mantle symmetry axis. It is thus equivalent to \u03b5 ,\nm\nthough we keep the tilde notation in the presentation of our results to emphasize that it rep-\nresents the real part of the solution from our system. Furthermore, since m\u02dc (cid:28) \u03b5\u02dc , we often\nm\nrefer to \u03b5\u02dc as the orientation of spin axis of the mantle, since the Cassini state of Mercury is\nm\nmore customarily described in terms of the latter in the literature.\nThe model of Mathews et al. [1991] is developed under the assumption of small angles as\nappropriate for the nutations on Earth. The details on how the equations of the model are de-\nrived can found in Mathews et al.

Three\nmodes have periods which, when seen in inertial space, are typically in the range of a few hun-\ndred to a few thousand years. The \ufb01rst is the free axial precession of Mercury maintained by\nthe solar torque acting on its elliptical \ufb01gure [e.g. Peale, 2005]. The second is the free core nu-\ntation (FCN), which is the free precession of the spin axis of the \ufb02uid core about the symme-\ntry axis of the CMB [e.g. Mathews et al., 1991]. The third is the free inner core nutation (FICN),\na free mode of rotation similar to the FCN but associated with the inner core [e.g. Mathews et al.,\n1991].\nA few remarks on our model are important to point out before we proceed further. First,\nalthough we have retained the triaxial shape of Mercury in the expression of the solar torque,\nwe treat its angular momentum response as if it were an axially symmetric body. This is con-\nvenient as the two equatorial angular momentum equations for each region can be combined\ninto a single equation. To \ufb01rst order, the frequency of the free precession of Mercury is not largely\naltered by triaxiality [e.g. Peale, 2005]. Baland et al. [2019] showed that the frequencies of the\nFCN and FICN for a triaxial planetary body may be slightly di\ufb00erent than those for an axi-\nally symmetric body, but not by large factor. As the response of Mercury to the solar torque\nis largely determined by the resonant ampli\ufb01cation due to the presence of these three modes,\nour model should capture correctly the \ufb01rst order Cassini state of Mercury. Considering the\ntriaxial shape of Mercury may alter the numerical results, but not our general conclusions.\nSecond, our modelling approach is di\ufb00erent than in the studies of Peale et al. [2014] and\nPeale et al. [2016]. In these two studies, dynamical models of Mercury\u2019s Cassini state are de-\nveloped and must then be integrated in time. The equilibrium Cassini state is the quasi-steady\nstate that remains after transient e\ufb00ects associated with the initial conditions have decayed away.\nAn advantage of these models compared to ours is that the complete triaxial dynamics of Mer-\ncury, including its longitudinal librations, are retained. However, the numerical integration can\nbe lengthy if dissipation is weak, which restricts the number of possible interior models of Mer-\ncury that can be tested. In contrast, our model is a simple linear system in the frequency do-\nmain, focused on one speci\ufb01c frequency: the forced precession associated with the Cassini state.\nSolutions are straightforward to obtain for a given interior model, and this allows us to cover\na larger span of the parameter space. One drawback, however, is that our model does not cap-\nture time-dependent variations at any other frequencies, including the precession of the peri-\ncenter of Mercury\u2019s orbit about the Sun.\n\u201312\u2013Con\ufb01dential manuscript submitted to JGR-Planets\n2.3 Analytical solutions and limiting cases\n2.3.1 The Cassini state of a single-body, rigid Mercury\nFor a rigid planet with no \ufb02uid and solid cores, our system of equations reduces to Equa-\ntions (12a) and (20),\n(\u03c9\u2212e)m\u02dc +\u03c6 \u03b5\u02dc =0, (23a)\nm m\nm\u02dc +(1+\u03c9)\u03b5\u02dc =\u2212(1+\u03c9)tanI.

(24b)\nm\nEquation (24b) gives a direct relationship between m\u02dc and \u03b5\u02dc . For I = 8.5330\u25e6, \u03b4\u03c9 =\nm\n4.9327\u00d710\u22127 and taking \u03b5\u02dc =2.04 arcmin, this gives m\u02dc =2.52\u00d710\u22124 arcmin, much smaller\nm\nthan \u03b5\u02dc : the o\ufb00set of the rotation axis of the mantle with respect to its symmetry axis is very\nm\nsmall.

One mode cor-\nresponds to the Eulerian wobble, or Chandler wobble, and represents the prograde precession\nof the rotation axis about the symmetry axis. The second mode is the free retrograde axial pre-\ncession of Mercury. As seen in the inertial frame, its frequency is given by\n\u201313\u2013Con\ufb01dential manuscript submitted to JGR-Planets\nMR2(cid:16) (cid:17)\n\u03c9 =n G J +2G C , (29)\nfp C 210 2 201 22\nwhich is equivalent to the prediction by Peale [2005] when neglecting its small elliptical com-\nponent. Note that in Peale [2005] it was assumed that only the mantle was involved in the solid-\nbody precession and hence C was replaced by C . Using C = 0.346 \u00b7 MR2 [Margot et al.,\nm\n2012] and the numerical values for n, J , C and e given in Table 1, we obtain a free preces-\n2 22 c\nsion period of T =2\u03c0/\u03c9 =1298 yr. If we use C instead of C in Equation (29), and take\nfp fp m\nC =0.431\u00b7C =0.431\u00b70.346\u00b7MR2 [Margot et al., 2012], we obtain T =2\u03c0/\u03c9 =560 yr.\nm fp fp\nThese estimates are similar to those obtained by Peale [2005]. Because the CMB is elliptical,\nthe pressure torque exerted on the \ufb02uid core by the mantle leads to an entrainment of the \ufb02uid\ncore, the degree of which depends on the amplitude of the pole-to-equator CMB \ufb02attening. The\ntrue free precession period lies somewhere between 560 and 1298 yr. Regardless of its exact value,\nthe free precession period is much shorter than the forcing period of 325 kyr. Using Equation\n(29), Equation (27) can be written as [e.g. Baland et al., 2017]\n\u2126 sinI\n\u03b5\u02dc = p .

Because \u03c9 >\u2126 , Mercury occupies Cassini state 1 [Peale,\nfp fp p\n1974]. Furthermore, Equation (30) shows that a large obliquity can be generated by resonant\nampli\ufb01cation if \u2126 \u2248 \u03c9 . Since \u03c9 (cid:29) \u2126 , resonant ampli\ufb01cation is minimal and the re-\np fp fp p\nsulting obliquity, \u03b5\u02dc \u22482 arcmin, is much smaller than the inclination angle I \u22488.5\u25e6.\nm\n2.3.2 The misalignment of the \ufb02uid and solid cores\nWith \u03c9 =\u22121\u2212\u03b4\u03c9cosI and \u03b4\u03c9 (cid:28)1, Equation (12d) gives n\u02dc \u2248m\u02dc ; as for the mantle,\ns s\nthe rotation and symmetry axes of the inner core remain closely aligned in the Cassini state.\nThe relationship between m\u02dc and \u03b5\u02dc of Equation (24b) is independent of the interior structure,\nm\nso it remains unchanged when a \ufb02uid and a solid cores are present. Substituting it in Equa-\ntion (12a), and setting n\u02dc =m\u02dc , the angular momentum equation of the whole planet becomes\ns s\nC\u2126 (cid:0)sinI+cosI\u03b5\u02dc (cid:1)+(A\u00af cosI\u2126 )m\u02dc +A\u00af (cosI\u2126 \u2212\u2126 \u03b1 \u03c6 )n\u02dc =A\u00af\u2126 \u03c6 \u03b5\u02dc .

These\nfrequencies depend on the interior density structure and are not known. However, we will show\nthat for reasonable interior models of Mercury, the FCN and FICN periods are in the range of\na few hundred yr.

The choice of C\u02c6 is determined from Equation (28). For the pa-\nm\nrameters listed in Table 1, and an observed obliquity of \u03b5 =2.04 arcmin [Margot et al., 2012],\nm\nthis gives C\u02c6 = C/MR2 = 0.3455 and all our interior models are consistent with this choice.\nObviously, this re\ufb02ects a Cassini state equilibrium in which the \ufb02uid core and inner core are\n\u201315\u2013Con\ufb01dential manuscript submitted to JGR-Planets\nperfectly aligned with the mantle, which is not strictly correct. Hence, we make an error in es-\ntimating C\u02c6 from Equation (28), or conversely in predicting \u03b5 based on a given choice for C\u02c6.\nm\nPart of the objective of our study is to estimate how large this error is. The ratio C /C is ob-\nm\ntained from the amplitude of the 88-day longitudinal mantle libration \u03c6 , which is given by\no\nMR2 C 1\n\u03c6 =6\u00b7f(e )C , (36)\no c 22 C C 1+\u03b6\nm\nwhere\n959\nf(e )=1\u221211e2+ e4, (37)\nc c 48 c\nand where \u03b6 is a correction that takes into account the entrainment of the inner core in the li-\nbration [Van Hoolst et al., 2012; Dumberry et al., 2013; Dumberry and Rivoldini, 2015]; this cor-\nrection is small and, to simplify, we neglect it here.

Our standard choice for the crustal thickness is h = 26 km [Sori, 2018], although in\nsection 3.2 we also present some results with other choices of h. We have considered two pos-\nsible prescriptions connected to the density of the inner core. First, for all the results presented\nin sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, we have used a \ufb01xed inner core density of \u03c1 =8800 kg m\u22123 ap-\ns\nproximately that obtained in Dumberry and Rivoldini [2015] under the assumption of a pure\nFe composition in face-centered cubic phase. This captures an end-member scenario where the\ncore composition is an Fe-S alloy; at Mercury\u2019s core conditions, crystallization of Fe is relatively\nfree of S on the Fe-rich side of the eutectic [Li et al., 2001]. If the core composition is instead\nan Fe-Si alloy, approximately equal partitioning of Si between the liquid and solid phase [e.g.\nSchaefer et al., 2017] implies a weak chemical contrast at the ICB. The density jump across the\nICB is expected to be small, although since density increases with depth, the contrast between\nthe mean densities of the \ufb02uid and solid cores is larger. It is these mean densities that enter\nour Mercury model with uniform density layers. To capture this other end-member core com-\nposition scenario, in section 3.5 we present results where we instead prescribe a \ufb01xed density\ncontrast between the \ufb02uid and solid core; speci\ufb01cally, we set the numerical value of \u03b1 .\n3\nFor a given choice of inner core radius r , the densities of the mantle (\u03c1 ) and \ufb02uid core\ns m\n(\u03c1 ) and the radius of the CMB (r ) are determined such that the interior model matches M,\nf f\nC\u02c6 = 0.3455 and C\u02c6 = 0.1475.

This is because of the relatively thin mantle of Mercury; for the largest\ns m\nr considered, the moment of inertia of the inner core can get close to 40% of that of the man-\ns\ntle and is not negligible. The period of the FCN when only interior torques contribute is shown\nin Figure 3b. It is close to 1100 yr for a small inner core, increasing to approximately 1500 yr\nat the largest r . Hence, the in\ufb02uence of the solar torque reduces the FCN period by a factor\ns\nof approximately 3. We note that the FICN period, in contrast, is not altered substantially when\nthe external torque is set to zero.\n3.2 Gravitational and inertial coupling\nLet us now investigate the obliquities of the mantle, \ufb02uid core and inner core in their equi-\nlibrium Cassini state. We assume a \ufb01xed inner core density scenario in this section, with \u03c1 =\ns\n8800 kg m\u22123. Viscous and EM coupling are set to zero in order to isolate the in\ufb02uence of grav-\nitational and inertial coupling. Figure 4 shows how \u03b5\u02dc , m\u02dc and n\u02dc vary as functions of inner\nm f s\ncore radius. We show calculations for three di\ufb00erent choices of crustal thickness, but let us con-\ncentrate \ufb01rst on the case for h=26 km. For small r , we retrieve an obliquity of \u03b5\u02dc =2.0494\ns m\narcmin (Figure 4a). \u03b5\u02dc decreases with r , but not substantially; at the largest r (1500 km),\nm s s\n\u03b5\u02dc = 2.0460 arcmin, a decrease of 0.0034 arcmin. The maximum di\ufb00erence from \u03b5\u02dc = 2.04\nm m\narcmin, the obliquity that we used in setting the constraint for C\u02c6 \u2013 and hence the prediction\nwe should recover for a rigid planet \u2013 is an overestimate of approximately 0.01 arcmin which\noccurs for small inner cores.\nThe deviation of \u03b5\u02dc from that of a rigid planet is due to the misalignments of the \ufb02uid\nm\ncore (m\u02dc ) and solid inner core (n\u02dc ) with respect to the mantle (Figure 4b). The misalignment\nf s\nof the \ufb02uid core spin axis from the mantle is signi\ufb01cant: m\u02dc is approximately 4.02 arcmin for\nf\na small inner core and does not vary substantially with inner core size; it drops to 3.97 arcmin\nat the largest r . Recall that m\u02dc is measured with respect to the mantle rotation axis (which\ns f\ncoincides closely with the symmetry axis), so the obliquity of the spin axis of the \ufb02uid core with\nrespect to the orbit normal is \u03b5\u02dc +m\u02dc \u22486 arcmin. The reason why the obliquity of the spin\nm f\naxis of the \ufb02uid core is larger than that of the mantle can be understood from Equation (32b),\nwhich shows that m\u02dc is determined by the resonant ampli\ufb01cation of the FCN mode at the forc-\nf\ning frequency. When the FCN frequency is much larger than the forcing frequency, as is the\ncase for Mercury, the resonant ampli\ufb01cation is very weak but remains present and m\u02dc is larger\nf\nthan zero.\nIn contrast to m\u02dc , the misalignment of the inner core with respect to the mantle is much\nf\nsmaller; n\u02dc is approximately between 0.023-0.025 arcmin, a factor 80 times smaller than \u03b5\u02dc .\ns m\nPhysically, this is because the gravitational torque acting on the inner core when it is tilted from\nthe mantle is much stronger than the inertial torque acting at the ICB. As a result, the inner\ncore must remain in close alignment with the mantle.

The factor \u03c7 captures then\nhow the core is entrained to precess with the mantle, with the coupling between the two ex-\npressed in terms of the resonant ampli\ufb01cation of the FCN and FICN frequencies. In the limit\nof \u03c3\u00af ,\u03c3\u00af \u2192 0, then \u03c7 = \u22121, C(cid:48) = C , the core is fully decoupled from the mantle and we\nf s m\nretrieve Equation (35).

As the inner core grows, A\u00af decreases, and the com-\nf\nbination A\u00af \u03c7 also decreases. This implies that C(cid:48) decreases with inner core size and, consequently,\nc\n\u03b5\u02dc also decreases with inner core size, as seen in Figure 4a, though it remains larger than the\nm\nprediction for a rigid planet.\nThe speci\ufb01c predictions of \u03b5\u02dc , m\u02dc and n\u02dc on Figure 4 depend sensitively on the assumed\nm f s\ninterior density model and on the dynamical ellipticities of the inner core (e ) and \ufb02uid core\ns\n(e ). Hence, it depends on the choices we have made for the inner core density \u03c1 , the crustal\nf s\ndensity \u03c1 and its thickness h. Changing \u03c1 , \u03c1 and/or h requires a di\ufb00erent combination of \u03c1 ,\nc s c f\n\u03c1 and r in order to match M, C\u02c6 and C\u02c6 . In turn, this leads to di\ufb00erent ellipticities at in-\nm f m\nterior boundary in order to match J and C , and thus di\ufb00erent predictions for \u03b5\u02dc , m\u02dc and\n2 22 m f\nn\u02dc . To illustrate this, we show on Figure 4 two additional predictions computed with crustal\ns\nthicknesses changed to h=16 and 36 km. The change in \u03b5\u02dc remains modest, \u223c0.025%, but\nm\nthe changes in m\u02dc and n\u02dc are more substantial, \u223c5% and \u223c10%, respectively.\nf s\nWe also show on Figure 4a (only for h=26 km) the obliquity of the principal moment\nof inertia of the whole planet, which we denote by \u03b5\u02dc .

Peale et al. [2014] present two di\ufb00erent parameterizations of viscous coupling based on\nthe timescale of attenuation of the di\ufb00erential rotation between the \ufb02uid core and mantle. More\ncomplete analytical solutions for the \ufb02ow resulting from a di\ufb00erentially precessing shell have\nbeen derived [e.g. Stewartson and Roberts, 1963; Busse, 1968; Rochester, 1976] and we exploit\nthese solutions here. The parametrization of the viscous coupling constants K and K based\ncmb icb\non them are given in Mathews and Guo [2005],\nK = \u03c0\u03c1frf4(cid:114) \u03bd (cid:16)0.195\u22121.976i(cid:17), (44a)\ncmb A\u00af 2\u2126\nf o\n\u03c0\u03c1 r4(cid:114) \u03bd (cid:16) (cid:17)\nK = f s 0.195\u22121.976i , (44b)\nicb A\u00af 2\u2126\ns o\nwhere \u03bd is the kinematic viscosity. The appropriate numerical value for \u03bd in planetary inte-\nrior is not well known but based on theoretical and experimental studies it is expected to be\nof the order of 10\u22126 m2 s\u22121 [e.g. Gans, 1972; de Wijs et al., 1998; Alf`e et al., 2000; Rutter et al.,\n2002a,b].\n\u201320\u2013Con\ufb01dential manuscript submitted to JGR-Planets\nThe above parameterizations are valid only under the assumption that the \ufb02ow in the bound-\nary layer remains laminar. Whether this is reasonable can be assessed by evaluating the Reynolds\nnumber Re=r \u2206u /\u03bd, associated with the di\ufb00erential velocity \u2206u =r \u2126 m\u02dc at the CMB.\nf f f f o f\nFor r = 2000 km, and taking m\u02dc = 4 arcmin \u2248 0.001 rad from the results in the previous\nf f\nsection, we get \u2206u \u223c 2 mm/s and Re \u223c 6\u00d7109. Such a large Reynolds number indicates\nf\nthat the viscous friction between the \ufb02uid core and mantle should induce turbulent \ufb02ows, as\nis the case for the Cassini state of the Moon [Yoder, 1981; Williams et al., 2001; C\u00b4ebron et al.,\n2019]. For a boundary layer that involves turbulent \ufb02ows, the viscous torque should be inde-\npendent of the \ufb02uid viscosity and proportional to the square of the di\ufb00erential velocity. The\ncoupling constant K should be in the form\ncmb\n(cid:12) (cid:12)(cid:16) (cid:17)\nKcmb =fcmb(cid:12)m\u02dcf(cid:12) 0.195\u22121.976i , (45)\nwhere f is a numerical factor that depends among other things on surface roughness. In-\ncmb\ncorporating a viscous coupling of this form in our rotational model is more challenging not only\nbecause f is not known but also because the viscous torque is no longer linear in m\u02dc . One\ncmb f\nstrategy is to \ufb01nd solutions through an iterative process. The simpler alternative strategy that\nwe adopt is to use the laminar formulas of Equation (44) but with the understanding that \u03bd\nrepresents an e\ufb00ective turbulent viscosity.\nTo give an estimate of an appropriate turbulent value for \u03bd, we turn to the Cassini state\nof the Moon. A measure of the viscous dissipation at the CMB of the Moon has been obtained\nby \ufb01tting a rotation model to the librations of the Moon observed by Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR)\n[Williams et al., 2001, 2014; Williams and Boggs, 2015]. Viscous dissipation is reported in terms\nof a coupling parameter K and a recent estimate is K/C =(1.41\u00b10.34)\u00d710\u22128 day\u22121 [Williams\nL\nand Boggs, 2015], where C is the lunar polar moment of inertia. The connection between K\nL\nand K is\ncmb\n(cid:12) (cid:12) K C 1\n(cid:12)Im[K ](cid:12)= L , (46)\n(cid:12) cmb (cid:12) C C \u2126\nL fL L\nwhere C is the moment of inertia of the lunar core and \u2126 = 2.66 \u00d7 10\u22126 s\u22121 the lunar\nfL L\nrotation rate. With C /C \u223c7\u00d710\u22124 [e.g. Williams et al., 2014], this gives |Im[K ]|\u223c\nfL L cmb\n9\u00d710\u22125. In order to match this amplitude in Equation (44a), with lunar parameters and as-\nsuming a lunar core radius of 400 km, the required turbulent viscosity is \u03bd \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 m2\ns\u22121, about 500 times larger than the laminar viscosity. Note that the di\ufb00erential velocity at the\nCMB of the Moon is closer to 3 cm/s [Yoder, 1981; Williams et al., 2001], more than 10 times\nlarger than our estimate for Mercury above. Since the e\ufb00ective turbulent coupling constant K\ncmb\nis proportional to the di\ufb00erential velocity, the e\ufb00ective turbulent viscosity appropriate for Mer-\ncury should be smaller. Thus, \u03bd \u22485\u00d710\u22124 m2 s\u22121 gives a conservative upper bound for the\npossible e\ufb00ective turbulent viscosity that can be expected for Mercury.\nFigure 5 shows how \u03b5\u02dc , m\u02dc and n\u02dc vary as functions of inner core radius for di\ufb00erent choices\nm f s\nof e\ufb00ective viscosities. For \u03bd = 10\u22125 m2 s\u22121, viscous coupling is too weak to a\ufb00ect \u03b5\u02dc and\nm\nm\u02dc and they are essentially unchanged from the solutions shown in Figure 4. With increasing\nf\n\u03bd, the stronger viscous coupling between the core and the mantle reduces their di\ufb00erential ve-\nlocity, and m\u02dc is reduced. With the reduced di\ufb00erential velocity at the CMB, the prediction\nf\nof \u03b5\u02dc gets closer to 2.04 arcmin, the obliquity expected for a rigid planet. Although our CMB\nm\nviscous coupling model is di\ufb00erent than the one used by Peale et al. [2014], our results for \u03b5\u02dc\nm\nand m\u02dc are qualitatively similar: viscous coupling at the CMB acts to reduce the o\ufb00set of the\nf\n\ufb02uid spin axis from the mantle symmetry axis. Considering the upper bound in turbulent vis-\ncosity that we have identi\ufb01ed above (i.e \u03bd \u2248 5\u00d710\u22124 m2 s\u22121), the in\ufb02uence of viscous cou-\n\u201321\u2013Con\ufb01dential manuscript submitted to JGR-Planets\nkinematic viscosity: 0.01 m2 s-1 0.001  m2 s-1 0.0005 m2 s-1 0.0001 m2 s-1 0.00001 m2 s-1\n4.5\na b\n2.050\n4.0\nn)2.048 n)3.5\nmi mi\narc2.046 \u03b5g arc3.0\ny angle (2.044 \u03b5m y angle (22..05 mf\nbliquit2.042 \u03b5 bliquit1.5 ns\nO m for a rigid planet O\n2.040 1.0\n0.5\n2.038\n0.0\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\nInner core radius (km) Inner core radius (km)\nFigure 5. a) Obliquity of the mantle (\u03b5\u02dc , solid lines) and gravity \ufb01eld (\u03b5\u02dc , dashed lines) b) m\u02dc\nm g f\n(solid lines) and n\u02dc (dashed lines) as a function of inner core radius and for di\ufb00erent choices of kinematic\ns\nviscosity (color in legend).\npling on \u03b5\u02dc remains modest, reducing its amplitude by a maximum of approximately 0.0015\nm\narcmin.\nThe inclusion of viscous coupling at the ICB can lead to a substantial change in inner core\ntilt. A larger viscosity leads to stronger viscous coupling and to a closer alignment of the in-\nner core with the \ufb02uid core spin axis. The viscous coupling strength is inversely proportional\nto r , so a larger viscosity results in a larger inner core radius at which viscous coupling is of\ns\na similar magnitude to gravitational coupling. Taking again an upper bound of \u03bd =5\u00d710\u22124\nm2 s\u22121, Figure 5 indicates that n\u02dc may be 1 arcmin or larger only if the inner core radius is\ns\nsmaller than approximately 100 km. For an inner core of a few hundred km in radius, gravi-\ntational coupling is much larger than viscous coupling, and the inner core tilt is limited to a\nfraction of 1 arcmin.\nThe larger inner core tilt observed with increasing e\ufb00ective viscosity results in a larger\no\ufb00set between the obliquity of the principal moment of inertia \u03b5\u02dc and that of the mantle \u03b5\u02dc ,\ng m\nthough it remains limited. For the upper bound of \u03bd = 5\u00d710\u22124 m2 s\u22121, and for r = 1500\ns\nkm, the di\ufb00erence between \u03b5\u02dc and \u03b5\u02dc is limited to 0.0013 arcmin.\ng m\nThe conclusion that emerges from Figure 5 is that the larger the inner core is, the smaller\nthe misalignments of both the \ufb02uid core and inner core are with respect to the mantle. This\nimplies that the larger the inner core is, the more we approach a planet precessing as a rigid\nbody, although the misalignment of the spin axis of the \ufb02uid core remains important, approx-\nimately 3-4 arcmin away from the mantle symmetry axis. The speci\ufb01c way in which \u03b5\u02dc , m\u02dc\nm f\nand n\u02dc change with inner core size would certainly be di\ufb00erent for a turbulent model of viscous\ns\ncoupling. But the general conclusion remains that the addition of viscous coupling at the CMB\nand ICB does not signi\ufb01cantly modify the Cassini state equilibrium angle of the mantle.\n\u201322\u2013Con\ufb01dential manuscript submitted to JGR-Planets\n3.4 Electromagnetic coupling\nLet us now turn to electromagnetic (EM) coupling. To focus on its role in the equilibrium\nCassini state, we set the viscous coupling back to zero. Because magnetic \ufb01eld lines tend to re-\nmain attached to electrically conducting materials, a di\ufb00erential tangential motion between two\nelectrically conducting regions stretches existing magnetic \ufb01eld lines that thread their interface.\nThis induces a secondary magnetic \ufb01eld (or equivalently, an electrical current) and an associ-\nated tangential EM stress resisting the di\ufb00erential motion. EM coupling at the CMB and ICB\nacts then in a similar way to viscous coupling, and this \u2019magnetic friction\u2019 depends on the strength\nof the radial magnetic \ufb01eld B and the electrical conductivity \u03c3 on either side of the bound-\nr\nary [Rochester, 1960, 1962, 1968].\nThe parametrization of EM coupling in terms of the coupling constants K and K\ncmb icb\nhas been developed in a few studies [e.g. Bu\ufb00ett, 1992; Bu\ufb00ett et al., 2002; Dumberry and Koot,\n2012]. Assuming a dominating axial dipole \ufb01eld, with a radial component at the CMB given\n\u221a\nby B = 3(cid:10)Bd(cid:11)cos\u03b8, where (cid:10)Bd(cid:11) is the r.m.s. strength of the \ufb01eld, the coupling constant\nr r r\nK can be written is the form\ncmb\nK =3(1\u2212i)F (cid:10)Bd(cid:11)2 , (47)\ncmb cmb r\nwhere\n1 (cid:18) 1 1 (cid:19)\u22121\nF = + , (48)\ncmb \u2126 \u03c1 r \u03c3 \u03b4 \u03c3 \u03b4\no f f m m f f\n(cid:112) (cid:112)\nand where \u03c3 , \u03b4 = 2/(\u03c3 \u00b5\u2126 ) and \u03c3 , \u03b4 = 2/(\u03c3 \u00b5\u2126 ) are the electrical conductivi-\nm m m o f f f o\nties and magnetic skin depths in the mantle and \ufb02uid core, respectively, with \u00b5=4\u03c0\u00d710\u22127\nN A\u22122 the magnetic permeability of free space.

(49)\nr 3 rf 1\nWe can readily build an estimate of the amplitude of K . The electrical conductivity\ncmb\nof common mantle minerals in Earth\u2019s mantle at the pressure and temperature corresponding\nto the CMB of Mercury is in the range of \u03c3 \u223c 0.01 \u2212 1 S m\u22121 [Constable, 2015]. In con-\nm\ntrast, the electrical conductivity of Fe in planetary cores is expected to be close \u03c3 \u223c 106 S\nf\nm\u22121 [Pozzo et al., 2012; de Koker et al., 2012].

To put this amplitude\nf cmb\nin perspective, taking a molecular viscosity of \u03bd =10\u22126 m2 s\u22121 in Equation (44a) gives a vis-\ncous coupling constant of K \u2248(6.0\u00d710\u22127)\u00b7(0.195\u22121.976i). Hence, EM coupling at the\ncmb\nCMB is much weaker than viscous coupling, even if we include other spherical harmonic com-\nponents of the radial magnetic \ufb01eld.\nEM coupling can be enhanced if strongly strati\ufb01ed pockets of core \ufb02uid are trapped by\nCMB cavities [Bu\ufb00ett, 2010; Glane and Bu\ufb00ett, 2018], in which case the e\ufb00ective \u03c3 could be\nm\ncloser to \u03c3 . Likewise, \u03c3 can be increased if a more electrically conducting layer has formed\nf m\nat the bottom of Mercury\u2019s mantle, for instance by the upward sedimentation and compaction\nof solid FeS crystals precipitating out of the \ufb02uid core [e.g. Hauck et al., 2013]. However, even\nin the extreme case of \u03c3 = \u03c3 = 106 S m\u22121, K \u2248 (1.6\u00d710\u22128)\u00b7(1\u2212i), which remains\nm f cmb\n\u201323\u2013Con\ufb01dential manuscript submitted to JGR-Planets\nsmaller by a factor \u223c60 than the smallest possible viscous coupling constant. Viscous forces\ndominate the tangential stress on the CMB of Mercury.\nAt the ICB, because we can expect the electrical conductivity in both the solid inner core\nand \ufb02uid core to be similar, and because the radial magnetic \ufb01eld is likely much stronger, EM\ncoupling can be much larger and dominate viscous coupling. We assume that the magnetic \ufb01eld\nmorphology at the ICB is dominantly comprised of small spatial scales for example as predicted\nby the dynamo model of Christensen [2006]. EM coupling in this case can be parametrized in\nterms of an equivalent uniform radial magnetic \ufb01eld (cid:104)B (cid:105) capturing its r.m.s. strength [Buf-\nr\nfett et al., 2002; Dumberry and Koot, 2012]. Assuming an electrical conductivity \u03c3 equal in the\n\ufb02uid and solid core, the coupling constant K can be written in the form\nicb\n5\nK = (1\u2212i)F (cid:104)B (cid:105)2 , (50)\nicb 4 icb r\nwhere\n\u03c3\u03b4\nF = , (51)\nicb \u2126 \u03c1 r\no s s\n(cid:112)\nand where \u03b4 = 2/(\u03c3\u00b5\u2126 ) is the magnetic skin depth. As F is inversely proportional to\no icb\nr , K is inversely proportional to inner core size. Note that computing the EM coupling based\ns icb\non the r.m.s. strength (cid:104)B (cid:105) rather than a true \ufb01eld morphology tends to overestimate the strength\nr\nof the coupling [Koot and Dumberry, 2013]. However, since the strength of the radial magnetic\n\ufb01eld at the ICB of Mercury is largely unknown, imperfections of the EM coupling model are\nabsorbed in the range of possible (cid:104)B (cid:105) values.\nr\nThe parametrization of Equation (50) is only valid in a \u2019weak \ufb01eld\u2019 regime [Bu\ufb00ett et al.,\n2002], when the feedback from the Lorentz force on the \ufb02ow in the \ufb02uid core can be neglected.\nWhen (cid:104)B (cid:105) is su\ufb03ciently large, this is no longer the case. EM coupling then enters a \u2019strong\nr\n\ufb01eld\u2019 regime [Bu\ufb00ett et al., 2002; Dumberry and Koot, 2012; Koot and Dumberry, 2013] in which\nK increases linearly with (cid:104)B (cid:105) instead of quadratically. A good approximation of K cal-\nicb r icb\nculated for Earth can be extracted from Figure 6a of Dumberry and Koot [2012],\nKE =(0.175\u2212i0.138)(cid:104)B (cid:105) , (52)\nicb r\nwhere (cid:104)B (cid:105) is in units of Tesla. The superscript E emphasizes that the numerical factors are\nr\nappropriate for the parameter values adopted for Earth in the computation of Dumberry and\nKoot [2012]. To adapt these numerical factors to Mercury, we write,\nF\nK =(0.175\u2212i0.138) icb (cid:104)B (cid:105) , (53)\nicb FE r\nicb\nwhere FE is de\ufb01ned as in Equation (51) but using the parameters for Earth as de\ufb01ned in Dumb-\nicb\nerry and Koot [2012]. These are \u2126 = 7.292 \u00d7 10\u22125 s\u22121, \u03c1 = 12846 kg m\u22123, r = 1221.5\no s s\nkm, \u03c3 =5\u00d7105 S m\u22121, which gives FE =90.36 T\u22122.\nicb\nTo compute F , we assume an electrical conductivity of \u03c3 =106 S m\u22121 in the core of\nicb\nMercury [e.g. de Koker et al., 2012; Deng et al., 2013]. The transition between the weak and\nstrong \ufb01eld regime occurs when (cid:104)B (cid:105) \u2248 1.53 mT for the real part of K . (cid:104)B (cid:105) at the ICB\nr icb r\nof Mercury is unknown. The dynamo model of Christensen [2006] showed that the \ufb01eld geom-\netry inside the core could be dominated by small length scales, yet only the weaker lower har-\nmonics of the \ufb01eld would penetrate through a thermally strati\ufb01ed layer in the upper region of\n\u201324\u2013Con\ufb01dential manuscript submitted to JGR-Planets\nthe \ufb02uid core and reach the surface. If so, the \ufb01eld strength inside the core can exceed the sur-\nface \ufb01eld strength by a factor 1000. Taking a surface \ufb01eld strength equal to \u223c300 nT [e.g An-\nderson et al., 2012], (cid:104)B (cid:105) at the ICB could be as large as 0.3 mT, corresponding to approxi-\nr\nmately 10% of the \ufb01eld strength within Earth\u2019s core. Given that it is perhaps unlikely that Mer-\ncury\u2019s \ufb01eld can be as high as that in Earth\u2019s core, in all likelihood EM coupling at the ICB of\nMercury remains in the weak \ufb01eld regime.\nFigure 6 shows how \u03b5\u02dc , m\u02dc and n\u02dc vary as functions of inner core radius for di\ufb00erent choices\nm f s\nof (cid:104)B (cid:105). The larger (cid:104)B (cid:105) is, the stronger is the EM coupling at the ICB, and the smaller is the\nr r\ndi\ufb00erential rotation between the \ufb02uid core and inner core. The inner core and \ufb02uid core are vir-\ntually locked into a common precession motion when (cid:104)B (cid:105)>0.3 mT. Further increasing (cid:104)B (cid:105)\nr r\nabove 1 mT does not change the solution as EM coupling already dominates all other torques\non the inner core. This is the case even when EM coupling transitions into the strong \ufb01eld regime.\n(cid:12) (cid:12)\nEM coupling at the CMB is included in these calculations, with \u03c3m = 1 S m\u22121 and (cid:12)g10(cid:12) =\n190 nT, but remains much weaker than the inertial torque at the CMB, so for a small inner core\nwe retrieved the solutions of \u03b5\u02dc and m\u02dc shown in Figure 4.\nm f\nAs the inner core radius is increased, both \u03b5\u02dc and m\u02dc get smaller, as it was the case with\nm f\nviscous coupling alone, although the addition of EM coupling lead to more substantial changes.\nThe inner core needs to be larger than approximately 500 km for changes in the Cassini state\nequilibrium to be noticeable. It is important to point out that m\u02dc is reduced not because of\nf\nEM coupling at the CMB, but rather from the combination of EM coupling at the ICB, which\npulls the \ufb02uid core towards an alignment with the inner core, and gravitational coupling on the\ninner core, which pulls the latter to align with the mantle. The larger the EM coupling is, the\ngreater is the reduction in \u03b5\u02dc and m\u02dc .\nm f\nWhen the EM coupling at the ICB is su\ufb03ciently strong that the \ufb02uid and solid cores are\nlocked into a common precession motion, a good approximation of \u03b5\u02dc is given by the same pre-\nm\ndiction as Equations (39-40) involving the e\ufb00ective moment of inertia C(cid:48), except \u03c7 is now given\nby\nA\u00af \u2126 cosI\u2212A\u00af \u2126 \u03b1 \u03c6\n\u03c7= c p s o 3 s .

Because A\u00af \u2126 \u03b1 \u03c6 increases\nc p s o 3 s s o 3 s\nwith inner core size, \u03c7 gets smaller, and so do C(cid:48) and \u03b5\u02dc . The mantle obliquity drops from 2.049\nm\narcmin for a small inner core to 2.034 arcmin for an inner core of 1500 km, a reduction of 0.015\narcmin. For an inner core larger than \u22481000 km, A\u00af \u2126 cosI <A\u00af \u2126 \u03b1 \u03c6 , so \u03c7 becomes neg-\nc p s o 3 s\native, C(cid:48) becomes smaller than the moment of inertia of a rigid Mercury C, and \u03b5\u02dc becomes\nm\nsmaller than the prediction based on a rigid planet.\nThe larger the inner core is, the smaller are the misalignments of the \ufb02uid and solid cores\nwith respect to the mantle. Hence, the general conclusion we reached for viscous coupling alone\nis not altered with the addition of EM coupling but further strengthened; the larger the inner\ncore is, the closer we approach a planet precessing as a rigid body. This is best revealed by the\nobliquity of the gravity \ufb01eld \u03b5\u02dc which, for a large inner core, asymptotically approaches the obliq-\ng\nuity expected for a rigid planet. Note that with strong EM coupling at the ICB, the o\ufb00set be-\ntween \u03b5\u02dc and \u03b5\u02dc can be as large as 0.008 arcmin for a large inner core.\nm g\n3.5 Fixed inner core density versus \ufb01xed ICB density contrast\nCoupling models when viscous and EM stresses are both present have been presented in\nMathews and Guo [2005] and Deleplace and Cardin [2006].

We take a radial\n\ufb01eld strength at the ICB of (cid:104)B (cid:105)=0.3 mT, approximately the \ufb01eld strength expected under\nr\nthe dynamo scenario of Christensen [2006]. We adopt these values as those of a \u2018representa-\ntive\u2019 coupling model, although the uncertainty on \u03bd and (cid:104)B (cid:105) obviously remains high.\nr\nFigure 7 shows how \u03b5\u02dc , m\u02dc and n\u02dc vary with inner core radius for the \u2019representative\u2019\nm f s\ncoupling model (black lines) under the \ufb01xed inner core density scenario that we have used in\nsections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4. Figure 7 also shows how the results change when, for the same rep-\nresentative coupling model, we adopt instead a \ufb01xed density contrast between the \ufb02uid and solid\ncores and for di\ufb00erent choices of \u03b1 (coloured lines). For a relatively high density contrast (\u03b1 =\n3 3\n0.2), the results are qualitatively similar to the \ufb01xed inner core density scenario. For a smaller\n\u03b1 , the point at which the orientation of the co-precessing \ufb02uid and inner cores begins to be\n3\npulled into an alignment with the mantle is pushed to a larger inner core radius. However, the\ngeneral behaviour of \u03b5\u02dc , m\u02dc and n\u02dc as functions of inner core radius is unchanged. Hence, all\nm f s\nour results in the previous three sections would be qualitatively similar under a \ufb01xed density\ncontrast scenario. A smaller density contrast at the ICB only implies that a larger inner core\nis required in order to produce an equivalent change in the Cassini state equilibrium.\n4 Discussion\nThe study of Peale et al.

To summarize\nm m f m f m f s m s\ntheir results, i(cid:48) and i(cid:48) vary substantially for di\ufb00erent inner core sizes, are always of compara-\nf s\nble amplitude, and i(cid:48) is always larger than i(cid:48). Furthermore, they \ufb01nd that as the inner core\ns f\nsize is increased, the mantle obliquity i(cid:48) gets progressively larger and is displaced further away\nm\nfrom its expected orientation based of a rigid planet (see their Figure 6). The change in i(cid:48) they\nm\nobtain between a case with no inner core and an inner core radius equal to 0.6 times the plan-\netary radius (\u22481463 km, close to the maximum inner core size of 1500 km we have considered),\nis approximately an increase of 5\u00d710\u22125 rad = 0.17 arcmin. This also corresponds approxi-\nmately to the deviation of the obliquity with respect to that of a rigid planet.\nWhen only viscous stress is included in our model (section 3.3), our results are substan-\ntially di\ufb00erent. As illustrated in Figure 4, we \ufb01nd instead that the obliquity of the \ufb02uid core\ngets smaller with inner core size and that the change is very modest. In contrast with the re-\nsults of Peale et al. [2016], we \ufb01nd that the inner core obliquity is typically smaller than that\nof the \ufb02uid core, except when the inner core is very small or when the e\ufb00ective viscosity is un-\nreasonably large. We also \ufb01nd that as the inner core size is increased, the mantle obliquity gets\nsmaller, opposite to the results of Peale et al. [2016], and that the changes remain small, at most\nof the order of 0.005 arcmin. A part of the di\ufb00erence is due to the di\ufb00erent viscous coupling\nmodel that we use. But even when we adopt their model parameters and use their viscosity model,\nwe were not able to reproduce their results.\nIn the absence of viscous and EM coupling, the strong gravitational torque exerted on the\ninner core by the mantle should prevent any large misalignment between the two. This is cap-\ntured by the period of the FICN, which is of the order of 100 yr, much shorter than the forc-\ning period of 325 kyr. Viscous and/or EM coupling at the ICB can counteract the gravitational\ntorque (and alter the period of the FICN), but only for a small inner core. The ratio of the viscous-\nEM torque to the gravitational torque decreases with inner core size, so a large inner core should\nbe more strongly aligned with the mantle. The more strongly the inner core and mantle are\n\u201327\u2013Con\ufb01dential manuscript submitted to JGR-Planets\ngravitationally locked together, the more they behave as a single rigid body in response to the\nexternal torque from the Sun. We expect then that the obliquity of the mantle should be brought\ncloser to that of a rigid planet when the inner core is larger. Hence, we \ufb01nd puzzling the re-\nsults of Peale et al. [2016], which suggest the opposite.\nWe showed that EM coupling is most likely larger than viscous coupling at the ICB, even\nthough our knowledge of the radial magnetic \ufb01eld strength inside Mercury (on which EM cou-\npling depends) remains poor. If the magnetic \ufb01eld strength at the ICB is above 0.3 mT, EM\ncoupling is su\ufb03ciently strong to bring the \ufb02uid and solid cores into a locked procession motion.\nThe larger the inner core is, the more this co-precessing core is forced into an alignment with\nthe mantle because of the mantle gravitational torque on the inner core. As a result, the larger\nthe inner core is, the closer we approach a situation resembling a whole planet precessing as\na rigid body. The addition of EM coupling at the ICB does not change the overall picture that\nwe observe with viscous coupling alone; the mantle obliquity decreases with inner core size. The\namplitude of the decrease can be as large as 0.015 arcmin, 3 times larger than for viscous cou-\npling alone; this remains a factor 10 smaller than the changes suggested in Peale et al. [2016],\nand again, importantly, in the reverse direction.\nOur results suggest then that the presence and size of an inner core leads to only mod-\nest changes of the mantle obliquity \u03b5 compared to the obliquity predicted on the basis of an\nm\nentirely rigid planet (\u03b5r ). Let us denote this di\ufb00erence as \u2206\u03b5 =\u03b5 \u2212\u03b5r . The largest \u2206\u03b5\nm m m m m\noccurs for a small or no inner core, and is \u2206\u03b5 \u2248 0.01 arcmin. This di\ufb00erence is decreased\nm\nas the inner core size is increased. For a su\ufb03ciently large inner core, in the case of a strong EM\ncoupling and large density contrast at the ICB, \u2206\u03b5 can be negative, but its absolute value\nm\nremains smaller than 0.01 arcmin.\nTo put these results in perspective, the uncertainty in the measurement of the mantle obliq-\nuity reported by Margot et al. [2012] and Stark et al. [2015a] is of the order of 0.08 arcmin, much\nlarger than this di\ufb00erence. This means that, at the current level of precision, it is not possi-\nble to distinguish the position of the mantle obliquity from the obliquity of a rigid planet. This\nis consistent with the fact that the observed obliquity falls close to that expected from a rigid\nplanet. But it also implies that the observed obliquity cannot be used to place constraints on\nthe inner core size.\nNevertheless, our results show that the presence of a \ufb02uid core and inner core a\ufb00ect the\nresulting mantle obliquity by as much as 0.01 arcmin. This is of the same order as the change\nin obliquity caused by elastic tidal deformation, which is of the order of 0.35 arcsec (\u22480.006\narcmin) [Baland et al., 2017]. This is also of the same order as the amplitude of the nutation\nmotion about the mean equilibrium Cassini state forced by the precession of the pericenter, which\nis approximately 0.85 arcsec (\u22480.014 arcmin) [Baland et al., 2017]. The precision on the obliq-\nuity from the upcoming BepiColombo satellite mission is expected to be \u22640.5 arcsec (\u22640.008\narcmin) [Cical`o et al., 2016]. Thus, in addition to including tidal deformation and the preces-\nsion of the pericenter, a Cassini state model that includes a \ufb02uid and solid core will then be\nnecessary in order to properly tie Mercury\u2019s obliquity to its interior structure. In turn, this opens\nthe possibility of further constraining the interior structure of Mercury on the basis of its obliq-\nuity.\nObliquity measurements based on tracking topographic features re\ufb02ect the orientation of\nthe spin-symmetry axis of the mantle (\u03b5 ). Measurements based on tracking the gravity \ufb01eld\nm\nof Mercury re\ufb02ect instead the orientation of the principal moment of the whole planet (\u03b5 ). These\ng\ntwo orientations do not coincide when an inner core is present and is misaligned from the man-\ntle. Since gravitational coupling prevents a large inner core tilt with respect to the mantle, we\n\u201328\u2013Con\ufb01dential manuscript submitted to JGR-Planets\n\ufb01nd that the misalignment \u2206\u03b5 = \u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5 is limited. The maximum o\ufb00set that we obtain\ng g m\nis approximately \u2206\u03b5 \u2248 0.007 arcmin. This limited magnitude of o\ufb00set is important in the\ng\nlight of the recent obliquity of the gravity \ufb01eld estimated in Genova et al. [2019], \u03b5 =1.968\u00b1\ng\n0.027 arcmin. This is substantially smaller than the two mesurements of the obliquity of the\nspin-symmetry axis of the mantle: \u03b5 = 2.04\u00b10.08 arcmin [Margot et al., 2012] and \u03b5 =\nm m\n2.029\u00b10.085 arcmin [Stark et al., 2015a], although all three measurements remain consistent\nwith one another within their error estimates. In their interpretation, Genova et al. [2019] sug-\ngest that the di\ufb00erent central value of the obliquity that they obtain (smaller by \u223c 0.07 ar-\ncmin) is perhaps explained by an o\ufb00set \u2206\u03b5 due to the presence of a (possibly large) solid in-\ng\nner core. However, this is one order of magnitude larger than the maximum magnitude of \u2206\u03b5\ng\nthat we predict. Moreover, we predict that the obliquity of the gravity \ufb01eld should be larger\nthan that of the mantle spin axis, not smaller. Hence, at the present-day level of the precision\nof the measurements, \u03b5 and \u03b5 should coincide, and their di\ufb00erence cannot be interpreted as\ng m\nre\ufb02ecting the misalignment between the polar moment of inertia of the whole planet and the\nmantle spin axis.\nLastly, we have concentrated our e\ufb00orts on the mutual orientations of the di\ufb00erent spin\nand symmetry axes in the Cassini plane. Dissipation at the CMB and ICB introduced by vis-\ncous and EM coupling also lead to a displacement of these axes in the direction perpendicu-\nlar to the Cassini plane [e.g Peale et al., 2014]. Indeed, the two measurements based on track-\ning surface topographic features from Margot et al. [2012] and Stark et al. [2015a] suggest that\nthe mantle spin axis lags behind the Cassini plane by approximately 2 arcsec (\u223c0.03 arcmin).\nAlthough this o\ufb00set is smaller than the measurement errors, so that the observed obliquity is\nstill consistent with no deviation away from the Cassini plane, some amount of dissipation in-\nvariably takes place. These measurements give then a measure of the possible amplitude of the\ndissipation. One source of dissipation is from anelastic tidal deformation [Baland et al., 2017],\nbut viscous and EM coupling at the boundaries of the \ufb02uid core is another. Hence, the out-of-\nplane component of the observed obliquity may further help to quantify and constrain the in-\nterior coupling mechanisms. This will be the subject of a future study.\n5 Conclusion\nWe have investigated how the presence of a \ufb02uid core and solid inner core a\ufb00ects the Cassini\nstate equilibrium of Mercury. Our general conclusion is that the coupling strength between Mer-\ncury\u2019s interior regions is su\ufb03ciently strong that the obliquity of the mantle spin-symmetry axis\ndoes not deviate from that of a rigid planet by more than 0.01 arcmin. This largest o\ufb00set oc-\ncurs for a small or no inner core. The larger the inner core is, the more it is forced into an align-\nment with the mantle because of the strong gravitational torque between the two, and the closer\nwe approach a situation resembling a whole planet precessing as a rigid body. The misalign-\nment between the polar moment of inertia and mantle spin axis increases with inner core size,\nbut is limited to approximately 0.007 arcmin. These conclusions apply irrespective of the core\ncomposition and thus of the partitioning of light elements into the solid core; a smaller den-\nsity contrast at the ICB only implies that a larger inner core is required in order to produce\nan equivalent change in the Cassini state equilibrium.\nOur results imply that the obliquities of the mantle spin axis and polar moment of iner-\ntia (or, equivalently, the gravity \ufb01eld) should coincide at the present-day level of measurement\nerrors. Moreover, neither of these can be distinguished from the obliquity predicted on the ba-\nsis of a rigid planet. However, the smaller measurement errors expected from the upcoming Bepi-\nColumbo satellite mission may permit this distinction, and thus provide further constraints on\nMercury\u2019s interior structure.\n\u201329\u2013Con\ufb01dential manuscript submitted to JGR-Planets\nAcknowledgments\nFigures were created using the GMT software [Wessel et al., 2013].

For FRB 20171019A we also conducted simultaneous observations with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) in very high energy gamma rays and searched for signals in the ultraviolet, optical, and X-ray bands. For this FRB, we obtain a UV flux upper limit of 1.39x10^-16 erg/cm^-2/s/Amstrong, X-ray limit of ~ 6.6x10^-14 erg/cm^-2/s and a limit on the very-high-energy gamma-ray flux (Phi) (E > 120 GeV) < 1.7 x 10^-12 erg/cm^-2/s. We obtain a radio upper limit of ~15 microJy/beam for persistent emission at the locations of both FRBs 20190711A and 20171019A, but detect diffuse radio emission with a peak brightness of ~53 microJy/beam associated with FRB 20190714A at z = 0.2365. This represents the first detection of the radio continuum emission potentially associated with the host (galaxy) of FRB 20190714A, and is only the third known FRB to have such an association. Given the possible association of a faint persistent source, FRB 20190714A may potentially be a repeating FRB whose age lies between that of FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916A. A parallel search for repeat bursts from these FRBs revealed no new detections down to a fluence of 0.08 Jy ms for a 1 ms duration burst.
